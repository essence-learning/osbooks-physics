## The Doppler Effect of Sound Waves
The  is a change in the observed pitch of a sound, due to relative motion between the source and the observer. An example of the Doppler effect due to the motion of a source occurs when you are standing still, and the sound of a siren coming from an ambulance shifts from high-pitch to low-pitch as it passes by. The closer the ambulance is to you, the more sudden the shift. The faster the ambulance moves, the greater the shift. We also hear this shift in frequency for passing race cars, airplanes, and trains. An example of the Doppler effect with a stationary source and moving observer is if you ride a train past a stationary warning bell, you will hear the bell’s frequency shift from high to low as you pass by.


What causes the Doppler effect? Let’s compare three different scenarios: Sound waves emitted by a stationary source ([Figure 1](#Figure_14_03_Stationary)), sound waves emitted by a moving source ([Figure 2](#Figure_14_03_MovingSrc)), and sound waves emitted by a stationary source but heard by moving observers ([Figure 3](#Figure_14_03_MovingObs)). In each case, the sound spreads out from the point where it was emitted.

If the source and observers are stationary, then observers on either side see the same wavelength and frequency as emitted by the source. But if the source is moving and continues to emit sound as it travels, then the air compressions (crests) become closer together in the direction in which it’s traveling and farther apart in the direction it’s traveling away from. Therefore, the wavelength is shorter in the direction the source is moving (on the right in [Figure 2](#Figure_14_03_MovingSrc)), and longer in the opposite direction (on the left in [Figure 2](#Figure_14_03_MovingSrc)).

Finally, if the observers move, as in [Figure 3](#Figure_14_03_MovingObs), the frequency at which they receive the compressions changes. The observer moving toward the source receives them at a higher frequency (and therefore shorter wavelength), and the person moving away from the source receives them at a lower frequency (and therefore longer wavelength).

***Figure 1** Sounds emitted by a source spread out in spherical waves. Because the source, observers, and air are stationary, the wavelength and frequency are the same in all directions and to all observers.*

***Figure 2** Sounds emitted by a source moving to the right spread out from the points at which they were emitted. The wavelength is reduced and, consequently, the frequency is increased in the direction of motion, so that the observer on the right hears a higher-pitch sound. The opposite is true for the observer on the left, where the wavelength is increased and the frequency is reduced.*

![One observer runs away from the sound source (a car) while another runs toward it.__ALT__Figure_14_03_MovingObs](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_14_03_MovingObs.jpg)
***Figure 3** The same effect is produced when the observers move relative to the source. Motion toward the source increases frequency as the observer on the right passes through more wave crests than she would if stationary. Motion away from the source decreases frequency as the observer on the left passes through fewer wave crests than he would if stationary.*

We know that wavelength and frequency are related by  <math> <mrow>  <mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>f</mi><mi>λ</mi><mtext>,</mtext></mrow></math>  where   where *v* is the fixed speed of sound. The sound moves in a medium and has the same speed *v* in that medium whether the source is moving or not. Therefore, *f*multiplied by  <math> <mi>λ</mi></math>  is a constant. Because the observer on the right in   is a constant. Because the observer on the right in [Figure 2](#Figure_14_03_MovingSrc) receives a shorter wavelength, the frequency she perceives must be higher. Similarly, the observer on the left receives a longer wavelength and therefore perceives a lower frequency.

The same thing happens in [Figure 3](#Figure_14_03_MovingObs). A higher frequency is perceived by the observer moving toward the source, and a lower frequency is perceived by an observer moving away from the source. In general, then, relative motion of source and observer toward one another increases the perceived frequency. Relative motion apart decreases the perceived frequency. The greater the relative speed is, the greater the effect.

For a stationary observer and a moving source of sound, the frequency (*f*) of sound perceived by the observer is

where *f* is the frequency of sound from a source, *v* is the speed of the source along a line joining the source and observer, and *v* is the speed of sound. The minus sign is used for motion toward the observer and the plus sign for motion away from the observer.

Using a plus sign will increase the denominator and decrease the observed frequency, consistent with what you would expect for the source moving away from the observer.

Note that the greater the speed of the source, the greater the Doppler effect. Similarly, for a stationary source and moving observer, the frequency perceived by the observer *f* is given by

where *v* is the speed of the observer along a line joining the source and observer. Here the plus sign is for motion toward the source, and the minus sign is for motion away from the source.

## Sonic Booms
What happens to the sound produced by a moving source, such as a jet airplane, that approaches or even exceeds the speed of sound? Suppose a jet airplane is coming nearly straight at you, emitting a sound of frequency *f*. The greater the plane’s speed, *v*, the greater the Doppler shift and the greater the value of *f*. Now, as *v* approaches the speed of sound, *v*, *f* approaches infinity, because the denominator in  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>f</mi>   <mrow>    <mi>o</mi><mi>b</mi><mi>s</mi></mrow>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo><msub>   <mi>f</mi>   <mi>s</mi>  </msub>  <mrow><mo>(</mo>   <mrow>    <mfrac>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>v</mi>       <mi>w</mi>      </msub>      </mrow>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>v</mi>       <mi>w</mi>      </msub>      <mo>−</mo><msub>       <mi>v</mi>       <mi>s</mi>      </msub>      </mrow>    </mfrac>    </mrow>  <mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>  approaches zero.  approaches zero.


This result means that at the speed of sound, in front of the source, each wave is superimposed on the previous one because the source moves forward at the speed of sound. The observer gets them all at the same instant, and so the frequency is theoretically infinite. If the source exceeds the speed of sound, no sound is received by the observer until the source has passed, so that the sounds from the source when it was approaching are stacked up with those from it when receding, creating a . A sonic boom is a constructive interference of sound created by an object moving faster than sound.

An aircraft creates two sonic booms, one from its nose and one from its tail (see [Figure 4](#Figure_14_03_SonicBoom)). During television coverage of space shuttle landings, two distinct booms could often be heard. These were separated by exactly the time it would take the shuttle to pass by a point. Observers on the ground often do not observe the aircraft creating the sonic boom, because it has passed by before the  reaches them. If the aircraft flies close by at low altitude, pressures in the sonic boom can be destructive enough to break windows. Because of this,  flights are banned over populated areas of the United States.

***Figure 4** Two sonic booms, created by the nose and tail of an aircraft, are observed on the ground after the plane has passed by.*

## Section Summary
* The Doppler effect is a shift in the observed frequency of a sound due to motion of either the source or the observer.
* The observed frequency is greater than the actual source’s frequency when the source and the observer are moving closer together, either by the source moving toward the observer or the observer moving toward the source.
* A sonic boom is constructive interference of sound created by an object moving faster than sound.
