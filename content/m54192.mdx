## Concepts Related to Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion
Examples of orbits abound. Hundreds of artificial satellites orbit Earth together with thousands of pieces of debris. The moon’s orbit around Earth has intrigued humans from time immemorial. The orbits of planets, asteroids, meteors, and comets around the sun are no less interesting. If we look farther, we see almost unimaginable numbers of stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects orbiting one another and interacting through gravity.

All these motions are governed by gravitational force. The orbital motions of objects in our own solar system are simple enough to describe with a few fairly simple laws. The orbits of planets and moons satisfy the following two conditions:

* The mass of the orbiting object, *m*, is small compared to the mass of the object it orbits, *M*.
* The system is isolated from other massive objects.

Based on the motion of the planets about the sun, Kepler devised a set of three classical laws, called , that describe the orbits of all bodies satisfying these two conditions:

* The orbit of each planet around the sun is an ellipse with the sun at one focus.
* Each planet moves so that an imaginary line drawn from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
* The ratio of the squares of the periods of any two planets about the sun is equal to the ratio of the cubes of their average distances from the sun.
These descriptive laws are named for the German astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630). He devised them after careful study (over some 20 years) of a large amount of meticulously recorded observations of planetary motion done by Tycho Brahe (1546–1601). Such careful collection and detailed recording of methods and data are hallmarks of good science. Data constitute the evidence from which new interpretations and meanings can be constructed. Let’s look closer at each of these laws.


### Kepler’s First Law
The orbit of each planet about the sun is an ellipse with the sun at one focus, as shown in [Figure 1](#Figure_07_01_circle). The planet’s closest approach to the sun is called  and its farthest distance from the sun is called .

![Three ellipses are shown. In image (a) the ellipse is divided into quadrants. In image (b) the sun and a planet are shown. In image (c), the sun and planet are shown, and the aphelion and perihelion.__ALT__Figure_07_01_circle](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_07_01_circle.jpg)
***Figure 1** (a) An ellipse is a closed curve such that the sum of the distances from a point on the curve to the two foci (*f* and *f*) is constant. (b) For any closed orbit, *m*follows an elliptical path with *M*at one focus. (c) The aphelion (*r*a) is the furthest distance between the planet and the sun, while the perihelion (*r*p) is the closest distance from the sun.*


If you know the aphelion (*r*) and perihelion (*r*) distances, then you can calculate the semi-major axis (*a*) and semi-minor axis (*b*).

***Figure 2** You can draw an ellipse as shown by putting a pin at each focus, and then placing a loop of string around a pen and the pins and tracing a line on the paper.*

### Kepler’s Second Law
Each planet moves so that an imaginary line drawn from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times, as shown in [Figure 3](#Figure_07_01_planet).

![A diagram shows a circle, divided into quadrants. The sun (labeled M) is inside the circle. The circle represents a planet’s orbit around the sun. The planet is labeled m. Shaded regions are labeled A1, A2, and A3__ALT__Figure_07_01_planet](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_07_01_planet.jpg)
***Figure 3** The shaded regions have equal areas. The time for *m*to go from A to B is the same as the time to go from C to D and from E to F. The mass *m*moves fastest when it is closest to *M*. Kepler’s second law was originally devised for planets orbiting the sun, but it has broader validity.*


> Note that while, for historical reasons, Kepler’s laws are stated for planets orbiting the sun, they are actually valid for all bodies satisfying the two previously stated conditions.
### Kepler’s Third Law
The ratio of the periods squared of any two planets around the sun is equal to the ratio of their average distances from the sun cubed. In equation form, this is

<equation id="fs-id1167066098361" class="unnumbered"><label /> <math display="block"> <mrow>  <mfrac>   <mrow>    <msubsup>     <mi>T</mi>     <mn>1</mn>     <mn>2</mn>    </msubsup>    </mrow>   <mrow>    <msubsup>     <mi>T</mi>     <mn>2</mn>     <mn>2</mn>    </msubsup>    </mrow>  </mfrac>  <mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mrow>    <msubsup>     <mi>r</mi>     <mn>1</mn>     <mn>3</mn>    </msubsup>    </mrow>   <mrow>    <msubsup>     <mi>r</mi>     <mn>2</mn>     <mn>3</mn>    </msubsup>    </mrow>  </mfrac>  <mo>,</mo></mrow></math> </equation>
where *T*is the  (time for one orbit) and *r*is the average distance (also called orbital radius). This equation is valid only for comparing two small masses orbiting a single large mass. Most importantly, this is only a descriptive equation; it gives no information about the cause of the equality.


> #### History: Ptolemy vs. Copernicus
> Before the discoveries of Kepler, Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, and others, the solar system was thought to revolve around Earth as shown in [Figure 4](#Figure_07_01_solar) **(a)**. This is called the , named for the Greek philosopher Ptolemy who lived in the second century AD. The Ptolemaic model is characterized by a list of facts for the motions of planets, with no explanation of cause and effect. There tended to be a different rule for each heavenly body and a general lack of simplicity.
> 
> [Figure 4](#Figure_07_01_solar) **(b)** represents the modern or . In this model, a small set of rules and a single underlying force explain not only all planetary motion in the solar system, but also all other situations involving gravity. The breadth and simplicity of the laws of physics are compelling.
> 
> ![Image a shows the Ptolemaic view of the solar system. This view shows Earth at the center of the solar system with all other planets orbiting clockwise, the moon circling the Earth, Mercury and Venus which go in wide circles as it orbits, which are called Epicycles. The Sun orbits earth between Venus and Mars. Mars circles opposite of the others, its own path shown with a looping arrow. Jupiter and Saturn come next. On the outside of the solar system are stars. Image b shows the Copernican view of the solar system which is the more traditional view of the solar system with the Sun in the center and the other planets orbiting the sun.__ALT__Figure_07_01_solar](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_07_01_solar.jpg)
> ***Figure 4** (a) The Ptolemaic model of the universe has Earth at the center with the moon, the planets, the sun, and the stars revolving about it in complex circular paths. This geocentric (Earth-centered) model, which can be made progressively more accurate by adding more circles, is purely descriptive, containing no hints about the causes of these motions. (b) The Copernican heliocentric (sun-centered) model is a simpler and more accurate model.*
> 
> Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543) first had the idea that the planets circle the sun, in about 1514. It took him almost 20 years to work out the mathematical details for his model. He waited another 10 years or so to publish his work. It is thought he hesitated because he was afraid people would make fun of his theory. Actually, the reaction of many people was more one of fear and anger. Many people felt the Copernican model threatened their basic belief system. About 100 years later, the astronomer Galileo was put under house arrest for providing evidence that planets, including Earth, orbited the sun. In all, it took almost 300 years for everyone to admit that Copernicus had been right all along.

Knowledge of these constants will help you determine positions and distances of objects in a system that includes one object orbiting another.

### Kepler’s Second Law
Refer back to [Figure 3](#Figure_07_01_planet). The second law says that the segments have equal area and that it takes equal time to sweep through each segment. That is, the time it takes to travel from A to B equals the time it takes to travel from C to D, and so forth. Velocity **v** equals distance *d* divided by time *t*:  <math> <mrow>  <mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><mi>v</mi></mstyle><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>/</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow>  </mrow></math> .

Then,  <math> <mrow>  <mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>/</mo><mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><mi>v</mi></mstyle></mrow>  </mrow></math>, so distance divided by velocity is also a constant. For example, if we know the average velocity of Earth on June 21 and December 21, we can compare the distance Earth travels on those days., so distance divided by velocity is also a constant. For example, if we know the average velocity of Earth on June 21 and December 21, we can compare the distance Earth travels on those days.

The degree of elongation of an elliptical orbit is called its  (*e*). Eccentricity is calculated by dividing the distance *f* from the center of an ellipse to one of the foci by half the long axis *a*.

When  <math> <mrow>  <mi>e</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math>, the ellipse is a circle., the ellipse is a circle.

The area of an ellipse is given by  <math> <mrow>  <mi>A</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>π</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>b</mi></mrow></math>, where , where *b* is half the short axis. If you know the axes of Earth’s orbit and the area Earth sweeps out in a given period of time, you can calculate the fraction of the year that has elapsed.

### Kepler’s Third Law
Kepler’s third law states that the ratio of the squares of the periods of any two planets (*T**, T*) is equal to the ratio of the cubes of their average orbital distance from the sun (*r**, r*). Mathematically, this is represented by

<equation id="fs-id1167064583666" class="unnumbered"> <math> <mrow>  <mfrac>   <mrow>    <msubsup>     <mi>T</mi>     <mn>1</mn>     <mn>2</mn>    </msubsup>    </mrow>   <mrow>    <msubsup>     <mi>T</mi>     <mn>2</mn>     <mn>2</mn>    </msubsup>    </mrow>  </mfrac>  <mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mrow>    <msubsup>     <mi>r</mi>     <mn>1</mn>     <mn>3</mn>    </msubsup>    </mrow>   <mrow>    <msubsup>     <mi>r</mi>     <mn>2</mn>     <mn>3</mn>    </msubsup>    </mrow>  </mfrac><mtext>.</mtext>  </mrow></math></equation>
From this equation, it follows that the ratio *r*<sup>3</sup>*/T*<sup>2</sup> is the same for all planets in the solar system. Later we will see how the work of Newton leads to a value for this constant.
