## Resistors in Parallel
In the previous section, we learned that resistors in series are resistors that are connected one after the other. If we instead combine resistors by connecting them next to each other, as shown in [Figure 1](#Figure_19_03_Circuit04), then the resistors are said to be connected *in parallel*. Resistors are  when both ends of each resistor are connected directly together.

Note that the tops of the resistors are all connected to the same wire, so the voltage at the top of the each resistor is the same. Likewise, the bottoms of the resistors are all connected to the same wire, so the voltage at the bottom of each resistor is the same. This means that the voltage drop across each resistor is the same. In this case, the voltage drop is the voltage rating *V* of the battery, because the top and bottom wires connect to the positive and negative terminals of the battery, respectively.

Although the voltage drop across each resistor is the same, we cannot say the same for the current running through each resistor. Thus,    are not necessarily the same, because the resistors    do not necessarily have the same resistance.

Note that the three resistors in [Figure 1](#Figure_19_03_Circuit04) provide three different paths through which the current can flow. This means that the equivalent resistance for these three resistors must be less than the smallest of the three resistors. To understand this, imagine that the smallest resistor is the only path through which the current can flow. Now add on the alternate paths by connecting other resistors in parallel. Because the current has more paths to go through, the overall resistance (i.e., the equivalent resistance) will decrease. Therefore, the equivalent resistance must be less than the smallest resistance of the parallel resistors.

***Figure 1** The left circuit diagram shows three resistors in parallel. The voltage *V* of the battery is applied across all three resistors. The currents that flow through each branch are not necessarily equal. The right circuit diagram shows an equivalent resistance that replaces the three parallel resistors.*


To find the equivalent resistance    of the three resistors  , we apply Ohm’s law to each resistor. Because the voltage drop across each resistor is *V*, we obtain


or


We also know from conservation of charge that the three currents    must add up to give the current *I* that goes through the battery. If this were not true, current would have to be mysteriously created or destroyed somewhere in the circuit, which is physically impossible. Thus, we have


Inserting the expressions for    into this equation gives


or


This formula is just Ohm’s law, with the factor in parentheses being the equivalent resistance.


Thus, the equivalent resistance for three resistors in parallel is


The same logic works for any number of resistors in parallel, so the general form of the equation that gives the equivalent resistance of *N* resistors connected in parallel is

## Resistors in Parallel and in Series
More complex connections of resistors are sometimes just combinations of series and parallel. Combinations of series and parallel resistors can be reduced to a single equivalent resistance by using the technique illustrated in [Figure 2](#Figure_19_03_Circuit05). Various parts are identified as either series or parallel, reduced to their equivalents, and further reduced until a single resistance is left. The process is more time consuming than difficult.

![Four steps are shown to simplify a complex circuit diagram of seven resistors to one with only a single equivalent resistor. Initially, two groups of parallel resistors, circled by the blue dashed loop, are combined; then, two resistors in series, circled by the red dashed loop, are combined, which is then combined with a resistor in parallel, circled by the green dashed loop; finally, two resistors in series are combined, circled by the purple dashed loop, yielding the final diagram.__ALT__Figure_19_03_Circuit05](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_19_03_circuit05.jpg)
***Figure 2** This combination of seven resistors has both series and parallel parts. Each is identified and reduced to an equivalent resistance, and these are further reduced until a single equivalent resistance is reached.*



Let’s work through the four steps in [Figure 2](#Figure_19_03_Circuit05) to reduce the seven resistors to a single equivalent resistor. To avoid distracting algebra, we’ll assume each resistor is 10   . In step 1, we reduce the two sets of parallel resistors circled by the blue dashed loop. The upper set has three resistors in parallel and will be reduced to a single equivalent resistor   . The lower set has two resistors in parallel and will be reduced to a single equivalent resistor   . Using the equation for the equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel, we obtain


These two equivalent resistances are encircled by the red dashed loop following step 1. They are in series, so we can use the equation for the equivalent resistance of resistors in series to reduce them to a single equivalent resistance   . This is done in step 2, with the result being


The equivalent resistor    appears in the green dashed loop following step 2. This resistor is in parallel with resistor  , so the pair can be replaced by the equivalent resistor  , which is given by


This is done in step 3. The resistor    is in series with the resistor  , as shown in the purple dashed loop following step 3. These two resistors are combined in the final step to form the final equivalent resistor  , which is


Thus, the entire combination of seven resistors may be replaced by a single resistor with a resistance of about 14.5   .

That was a lot of work, and you might be asking why we do it. It’s important for us to know the equivalent resistance of the entire circuit so that we can calculate the current flowing through the circuit. Ohm’s law tells us that the current flowing through a circuit depends on the resistance of the circuit and the voltage across the circuit. But to know the current, we must first know the equivalent resistance.

Here is a general approach to find the equivalent resistor for any arbitrary combination of resistors:

* Identify a group of resistors that are only in parallel or only in series.
* For resistors in series, use the equation for the equivalent resistance of resistors in series to reduce them to a single equivalent resistance. For resistors in parallel, use the equation for the equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel to reduce them to a single equivalent resistance.
* Draw a new circuit diagram with the resistors from step 1 replaced by their equivalent resistor.
* If more than one resistor remains in the circuit, return to step 1 and repeat. Otherwise, you are finished.
> ### Robot
> Robots have captured our collective imagination for over a century. Now, this dream of creating clever machines to do our dirty work, or sometimes just to keep us company, is becoming a reality. *Robotics* has become a huge field of research and development, with some technology already being commercialized. Think of the small autonomous vacuum cleaners, for example.
> 
> [Figure 3](#Figure_19_03_Robots) shows just a few of the multitude of different forms robots can take. The most advanced humanoid robots can walk, pour drinks, even dance (albeit not very gracefully). Other robots are bio-inspired, such as the *dogbot* shown in the middle photograph of [Figure 3](#Figure_19_03_Robots). This robot can carry hundreds of pounds of load over rough terrain. The photograph on the right in [Figure 3](#Figure_19_03_Robots) shows the inner workings of an *M-block,* developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These simple-looking blocks contain inertial wheels and electromagnets that allow them to spin and flip into the air and snap together in a variety of shapes. By communicating wirelessly between themselves, they self-assemble into a variety of shapes, such as desks, chairs, and someday maybe even buildings.
> 
> All robots involve an immense amount of physics and engineering. The simple act of pouring a drink has only recently been mastered by robots, after over 30 years of research and development! The balance and timing that we humans take for granted is in fact a very tricky act to follow, requiring excellent balance, dexterity, and feedback. To master this requires sensors to detect balance, computing power to analyze the data and communicate the appropriate compensating actions, and joints and actuators to implement the required actions.
> 
> In addition to sensing gravity or acceleration, robots can contain multiple different sensors to detect light, sound, temperature, smell, taste, etc. These devices are all based on the physical principles that you are studying in this text. For example, the optics used for robotic vision are similar to those used in your digital cameras: pixelated semiconducting detectors in which light is converted into electrical signals. To detect temperature, simple thermistors may be used, which are resistors whose resistance changes depending on temperature.
> 
> Building a robot today is much less arduous than it was a few years ago. Numerous companies now offer kits for building robots. These range in complexity something suitable for elementary school children to something that would challenge the best professional engineers. If interested, you may find these easily on the Internet and start making your own robot today.

> ### Resistors in Parallel
> This video shows a lecturer discussing a simple circuit with a battery and a pair of resistors in parallel. He emphasizes that electrons flow in the direction opposite to that of the positive current and also makes use of the fact that the voltage is the same at all points on an ideal wire. The derivation is quite similar to what is done in this text, but the lecturer goes through it well, explaining each step.

## Check Your Understanding


## Section Summary
* The equivalent resistance of a group of *N* identical resistors *R* connected in parallel is *R*/*N*.
* Connecting resistors in parallel provides more paths for the current to go through, so the equivalent resistance is always less than the smallest resistance of the parallel resistors.
* The same voltage drop occurs across all resistors in parallel; however, the current through each resistor can differ.
