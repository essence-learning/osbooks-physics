## Rotational Kinematics

In the section on uniform circular motion, we discussed motion in a circle at constant speed and, therefore, constant angular velocity. However, there are times when angular velocity is not constant—rotational motion can speed up, slow down, or reverse directions. Angular velocity is not constant when a spinning skater pulls in her arms, when a child pushes a merry-go-round to make it rotate, or when a CD slows to a halt when switched off. In all these cases,  occurs because the angular velocity    changes. The faster the change occurs, the greater is the angular acceleration. Angular acceleration    is the rate of change of angular velocity. In equation form, average angular acceleration is


where    is the change in angular velocity and    is the change in time. The units of angular acceleration are (rad/s)/s, or rad/s<sup>2</sup>. If    increases, then    is positive. If    decreases, then    is negative. Keep in mind that, by convention, counterclockwise is the positive direction and clockwise is the negative direction. For example, the skater in [Figure 1](#Figure_06_03_IceSkater) is rotating counterclockwise as seen from above, so her angular velocity is positive. Acceleration would be negative, for example, when an object that is rotating counterclockwise slows down. It would be positive when an object that is rotating counterclockwise speeds up.

The relationship between the magnitudes of , **a**, and angular acceleration,


These equations mean that the magnitudes of tangential acceleration and angular acceleration are directly proportional to each other. The greater the angular acceleration, the larger the change in tangential acceleration, and vice versa. For example, consider riders in their pods on a Ferris wheel at rest. A Ferris wheel with greater angular acceleration will give the riders greater tangential acceleration because, as the Ferris wheel increases its rate of spinning, it also increases its . Note that the radius of the spinning object also matters. For example, for a given angular acceleration  , a smaller Ferris wheel leads to a smaller tangential acceleration for the riders.

> Tangential acceleration is sometimes denoted **a**. It is a  in a direction tangent to the circle at the point of interest in circular or rotational motion. Remember that tangential acceleration is parallel to the tangential velocity (either in the same direction or in the opposite direction.)  is always perpendicular to the tangential velocity.
So far, we have defined three rotational variables:  ,  , and  .  These are the angular versions of the linear variables x, v, and a. The following equations in the table represent the magnitude of the rotational variables and only when the radius is constant and perpendicular to the rotational variable. [Figure __REPLACE_Table_06_02__](#Table_06_02) shows how they are related.

We can now begin to see how rotational quantities like  ,  , and     are related to each other. For example, if a motorcycle wheel that starts at rest has a large angular acceleration for a fairly long time, it ends up spinning rapidly and rotates through many revolutions. Putting this in terms of the variables, if the wheel’s angular acceleration    is large for a long period of time *t*, then the final angular velocity    and angle of rotation    are large. In the case of linear motion, if an object starts at rest and undergoes a large linear acceleration, then it has a large final velocity and will have traveled a large distance.

The  describes the relationships between the angle of rotation, angular velocity, angular acceleration, and time. It only *describes* motion—it does not include any forces or masses that may affect rotation (these are part of dynamics). Recall the kinematics equation for linear motion:    (constant **a**).

As in linear kinematics, we assume **a** is constant, which means that angular acceleration    is also a constant, because   . The equation for the kinematics relationship between  ,  , and *t* is



where    is the initial angular velocity. Notice that the equation is identical to the linear version, except with angular analogs of the linear variables. In fact, all of the linear kinematics equations have rotational analogs, which are given in [Figure __REPLACE_Table_06_03__](#Table_06_03). These equations can be used to solve rotational or linear kinematics problem in which **a** and    are constant.

> Storm chasers tend to fall into one of four groups: Amateurs chasing tornadoes as a hobby, atmospheric scientists gathering data for research, weather watchers for news media, or scientists having fun under the guise of work. Storm chasing is a dangerous pastime because tornadoes can change course rapidly with little warning. Since storm chasers follow in the wake of the destruction left by tornadoes, changing flat tires due to debris left on the highway is common. The most active part of the world for tornadoes, called *tornado alley*, is in the central United States, between the Rocky Mountains and Appalachian Mountains.
> 
> Tornadoes are perfect examples of rotational motion in action in nature. They come out of severe thunderstorms called supercells, which have a column of air rotating around a horizontal axis, usually about four miles across. The difference in wind speeds between the strong cold winds higher up in the atmosphere in the jet stream and weaker winds traveling north from the Gulf of Mexico causes the axis of the column of rotating air to shift as the storm travels so that the axis becomes vertical, creating a tornado.
> 
> Tornadoes produce wind speeds as high as 500 km/h (approximately 300 miles/h), particularly at the bottom where the funnel is narrowest because the rate of rotation increases as the radius decreases. They blow houses away as if they were made of paper and have been known to pierce tree trunks with pieces of straw.
## Torque
If you have ever spun a bike wheel or pushed a merry-go-round, you know that force is needed to change angular velocity. The farther the force is applied from the  (or ), the greater the angular acceleration. For example, a door opens slowly if you push too close to its hinge, but opens easily if you push far from the hinges. Furthermore, we know that the more massive the door is, the more slowly it opens; this is because angular acceleration is inversely proportional to mass. These relationships are very similar to the relationships between force, mass, and acceleration from Newton’s second law of motion. Since we have already covered the angular versions of distance, velocity and time, you may wonder what the angular version of force is, and how it relates to linear force.

The angular version of force is   , which is the turning effectiveness of a force. See [Figure 3](#Figure_06_03_MerryGoRound). The equation for the magnitude of torque is


where *r* is the distance from the pivot point to the point where the force is applied, **F** is the magnitude of the linear force, and    is the angle between the lever arm and the force. The  is the vector from the point of rotation (pivot point or fulcrum) to the location where force is applied. Since the magnitude of the lever arm is a distance, its units are in meters, and torque has units of N⋅m. Torque is a vector quantity and has the same direction as the angular acceleration that it produces.

![The figure shows an illustration of a merry-go-round with a radius of r and a man pushing on a bar on the circumference with an arrow indicating a force of F. To the right of the diagram, it is noted that F is perpendicular to r for maximum alpha.__ALT__Figure_06_03_MerryGoRound](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_06_03_MerryGo.jpg)
***Figure 3** A man pushes a merry-go-round at its edge and perpendicular to the lever arm to achieve maximum torque.*

Applying a stronger torque will produce a greater angular acceleration. For example, the harder the man pushes the merry-go-round in [Figure 3](#Figure_06_03_MerryGoRound), the faster it accelerates. Furthermore, the more massive the merry-go-round is, the slower it accelerates for the same torque. If the man wants to maximize the effect of his force on the merry-go-round, he should push as far from the center as possible to get the largest lever arm and, therefore, the greatest torque and angular acceleration. Torque is also maximized when the force is applied perpendicular to the lever arm.


## Solving Rotational Kinematics and Torque Problems
Just as linear forces can balance to produce zero net force and no linear acceleration, the same is true of rotational motion. When two torques of equal magnitude act in opposing directions, there is no net torque and no angular acceleration, as you can see in the following video. If zero net torque acts on a system spinning at a constant angular velocity, the system will continue to spin at the same angular velocity.

> ### Introduction to Torque
> This  defines torque in terms of moment arm (which is the same as lever arm). It also covers a problem with forces acting in opposing directions about a pivot point. (At this stage, you can ignore Sal’s references to work and mechanical advantage.)

Now let’s look at examples applying rotational kinematics to a fishing reel and the concept of torque to a merry-go-round.

* Torque is the effectiveness of a force to change the rotational speed of an object. Torque is the rotational analog of force.
* The lever arm is the distance between the point of rotation (pivot point) and the location where force is applied.
* Torque is maximized by applying force perpendicular to the lever arm and at a point as far as possible from the pivot point or fulcrum. If torque is zero, angular acceleration is zero.
