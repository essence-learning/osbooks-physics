## Types of Electromagnetic Wave Behavior
In a vacuum, all electromagnetic radiation travels at the same incredible speed of 3.00 × 10<sup>8</sup> m/s, which is equal to 671 million miles per hour. This is one of the fundamental physical constants. It is referred to as the speed of light and is given the symbol *c*. The space between celestial bodies is a near vacuum, so the light we see from the Sun, stars, and other planets has traveled here at the speed of light. Keep in mind that all EM radiation travels at this speed. All the different wavelengths of radiation that leave the Sun make the trip to Earth in the same amount of time. That trip takes 8.3 minutes. Light from the nearest star, besides the Sun, takes 4.2 years to reach Earth, and light from the nearest galaxy—a dwarf galaxy that orbits the Milky Way—travels 25,000 years on its way to Earth. You can see why we call very long distances *astronomical*.

When light travels through a physical medium, its speed is always less than the speed of light. For example, light travels in water at three-fourths the value of *c*. In air, light has a speed that is just slightly slower than in empty space: 99.97 percent of *c*. Diamond slows light down to just 41 percent of *c*. When light changes speeds at a boundary between media, it also changes direction. The greater the difference in speeds, the more the path of light bends. In other chapters, we look at this bending, called *refraction*, in greater detail. We introduce refraction here to help explain a phenomenon called .


Have you ever wondered about the rainbow colors you often see on soap bubbles, oil slicks, and compact discs? This occurs when light is both refracted by and reflected from a very thin film. The diagram shows the path of light through such a thin film. The symbols *n*, *n*, and *n* indicate that light travels at different speeds in each of the three materials. Learn more about this topic in the chapter on diffraction and interference.

[Figure 1](#Figure_15_02_Thinfilm) shows the result of thin film interference on the surface of soap bubbles. Because ray 2 travels a greater distance, the two rays become *out of phase*. That is, the crests of the two emerging waves are no longer moving together. This causes , which reinforces the intensity of the wavelengths of light that create the bands of color. The color bands are separated because each color has a different wavelength. Also, the thickness of the film is not uniform, and different thicknesses cause colors of different wavelengths to interfere in different places. Note that the film must be very, very thin—somewhere in the vicinity of the wavelengths of visible light.

![This diagram shows three areas separated by two parallel, horizontal lines. The distance between the two lines is labeled “t”. The top area, labeled n subscript 1, has a white background. The middle area, labeled n subscript 2, has a hazy bluish background. The bottom area, labeled n subscript 3, has a hazy gray background. An arrow labeled “Incident light” starts from the top left of the white area, points in a southeasterly direction, and ends on the upper horizontal line. At that point, two arrows emerge: one of them, labeled number 1, travels back through the white area in the northeast direction; the other travels through the bluish area in a south-southeast direction until it reaches the lower horizontal line. At the point where the lower arrow ends, another arrow begins, pointing in the north-northeast direction until it reaches the upper horizontal line. From that junction, a new arrow emerges, labeled number 2, traveling in the white area and parallel to the arrow labeled number 1. A human eye observes the arrows marked 1 and 2.__ALT__Figure_15_02_Thinfilm](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_15_02_Thinfilm.jpg)
***Figure 1** Light striking a thin film is partially reflected (ray 1) and partially refracted at the top surface. The refracted ray is partially reflected at the bottom surface and emerges as ray 2. These rays will interfere in a way that depends on the thickness of the film and the indices of refraction of the various media.*


You have probably experienced how polarized sunglasses reduce glare from the surface of water or snow. The effect is caused by the wave nature of light. Looking back at [Figure __REPLACE_Figure_15_01_EMwave__](#Figure_15_01_EMwave), we see that the electric field moves in only one direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Light from most sources vibrates in all directions perpendicular to propagation. Light with an electric field that vibrates in only one direction is called *polarized*. A diagram of  would look like [Figure __REPLACE_Figure_15_01_EMwave__](#Figure_15_01_EMwave).

Polarized glasses are an example of a polarizing filter. These glasses absorb most of the horizontal light waves and transmit the vertical waves. This cuts down glare, which is caused by horizontal waves. [Figure 2](#Figure_15_02_Rope) shows how waves traveling along a rope can be used as a model of how a polarizing filter works. The oscillations in one rope are in a vertical plane and are said to be vertically polarized. Those in the other rope are in a horizontal plane and are horizontally polarized. If a vertical slit is placed on the first rope, the waves pass through. However, a vertical slit blocks the horizontally polarized waves. For EM waves, the direction of the electric field oscillation is analogous to the disturbances on the ropes.

![This figure has two panels arranged side by side. The left panel, labeled “(a)”, shows a hand holding one end of a wave moving in a vertical plane and passing through a vertically oriented slit. Next to the hand is a double-headed vertical arrow labeled “Direction of polarization”. The right panel, labeled “(b)”, shows a hand holding one end of a wave moving in a horizontal plane and passing through a horizontally oriented slit. Next to the hand is a double-headed horizontal arrow labeled “Direction of polarization.__ALT__Figure_15_02_Rope](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_15_02_Rope.jpg)
***Figure 2** The transverse oscillations in one rope are in a vertical plane, and those in the other rope are in a horizontal plane. The first is said to be vertically polarized, and the other is said to be horizontally polarized. Vertical slits pass vertically polarized waves and block horizontally polarized waves.*

Light can also be polarized by reflection. Most of the light reflected from water, glass, or any highly reflective surface is polarized horizontally. [Figure 3](#Figure_15_02_Reflection) shows the effect of a polarizing lens on light reflected from the surface of water.

![This figure shows two photographs arranged side by side. The left photograph, labeled “(a)”, shows a river bed that looks hazy because of interfering gray and white patches. The right photograph, labeled “(b)”, shows the same area of the river bed with almost no interfering gray patches, so that the pebbles on the bed are clearly visible.__ALT__Figure_15_02_Reflection](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_15_02_Reflection.jpg)
***Figure 3** These two photographs of a river show the effect of a polarizing filter in reducing glare in light reflected from the surface of water. Part (b) of this figure was taken with a polarizing filter and part (a) was taken without. As a result, the reflection of clouds and sky observed in part (a) is not observed in part (b). Polarizing sunglasses are particularly useful on snow and water.*

## Quantitative Treatment of Electromagnetic Waves

We can use the speed of light, *c*, to carry out several simple but interesting calculations. If we know the distance to a celestial object, we can calculate how long it takes its light to reach us. Of course, we can also make the reverse calculation if we know the time it takes for the light to travel to us. For an object at a very great distance from Earth, it takes many years for its light to reach us. This means that we are looking at the object as it existed in the distant past. The object may, in fact, no longer exist. Very large distances in the universe are measured in . One light year is the distance that light travels in one year, which is  
 kilometers or 
 miles (…and 10<sup>12</sup> is a trillion!).

A useful equation involving *c* is


where *f* is frequency in Hz, and    is wavelength in meters.

> ### Frequency and Wavelength Calculation

The rate at which light is radiated from a source is called , *P*, and it is measured in  (lm). Energy-saving light bulbs, which provide more luminous flux for a given use of electricity, are now available. One of these bulbs is called a *compact fluorescent lamp*; another is an *LED* (light-emitting diode) bulb. If you wanted to replace an old incandescent bulb with an energy saving bulb, you would want the new bulb to have the same brightness as the old one. To compare bulbs accurately, you would need to compare the lumens each one puts out. Comparing wattage—that is, the electric power used—would be misleading. Both wattage and lumens are stated on the packaging.

The luminous flux of a bulb might be 2,000 lm. That accounts for all the light radiated in all directions. However, what we really need to know is how much light falls on an object, such as a book, at a specific distance. The number of lumens per square meter is called , and is given in units of  (lx). Picture a light bulb in the middle of a sphere with a 1-m radius. The total surface of the sphere equals 4π*r*<sup>2</sup> m<sup>2</sup>. The illuminance then is given by


What happens if the radius of the sphere is increased 2 m? The illuminance is now only one-fourth as great, because the *r*<sup>2</sup> term in the denominator is 4 instead of 1. [Figure 4](#Figure_15_02_Illuminance) shows how illuminance decreases with the inverse square of the distance.

![This diagram shows a small sphere on the left, labeled “Source of Electromagnetic Radiation”, and a series of arrows emerging from it, pointing rightward. Three curved surfaces are separated from the sphere by distances labeled as “r”, “2r”, and “3r”. One of these surfaces is labeled “Part of the surface of a sphere with radius r”. The arrows penetrate these three surfaces and move farther and farther apart as they move away from the sphere.__ALT__Figure_15_02_Illuminance](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_15_02_Illuminanc.jpg)
***Figure 4** The diagram shows why the illuminance varies inversely with the square of the distance from a source of light.*
