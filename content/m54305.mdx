## Pressure, Volume, Temperature, and the Ideal Gas Law

Before covering the first law of thermodynamics, it is first important to understand the relationship between , volume, and temperature. Pressure, *P*, is defined as


where *F*is a force applied to an area, *A*, that is perpendicular to the force.

Depending on the area over which it is exerted, a given force can have a significantly different effect, as shown in [Figure 1](#Figure_12_02_Shot).

![In part (a), a finger pokes a man’s arm. In part (b), a needle pokes a man’s arm with the same force but over a smaller area, resulting in greater pressure.__ALT__Figure_12_02_Shot](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_12_02_shot.jpg)
***Figure 1** (a) Although the person being poked with the finger might be irritated, the force has little lasting effect. (b) In contrast, the same force applied to an area the size of the sharp end of a needle is great enough to break the skin.*

The SI unit for pressure is the *pascal*, where

Pressure is defined for all states of matter but is particularly important when discussing fluids (such as air). You have probably heard the word *pressure* being used in relation to blood (high or low blood pressure) and in relation to the weather (high- and low-pressure weather systems). These are only two of many examples of pressures in fluids.

The relationship between the pressure, volume, and temperature for an ideal gas is given by the . A gas is considered ideal at low pressure and fairly high temperature, and forces between its component particles can be ignored. The ideal gas law states that


where *P*is the pressure of a gas, *V*is the volume it occupies, *N*is the number of particles (atoms or molecules) in the gas, and *T*is its absolute temperature. The constant *k*is called the  and has the value    For the purposes of this chapter, we will not go into calculations using the ideal gas law. Instead, it is important for us to notice from the equation that the following are true for a given mass of gas:

* When volume is constant, pressure is directly proportional to temperature.
* When temperature is constant, pressure is inversely proportional to volume.
* When pressure is constant, volume is directly proportional to temperature.
This last point describes *thermal expansion*—the change in size or volume of a given mass with temperature. What is the underlying cause of thermal expansion? An increase in temperature means that there’s an increase in the kinetic energy of the individual atoms. Gases are especially affected by thermal expansion, although liquids expand to a lesser extent with similar increases in temperature, and even solids have minor expansions at higher temperatures. This is why railroad tracks and bridges have expansion joints that allow them to freely expand and contract with temperature changes.


To get some idea of how pressure, temperature, and volume of a gas are related to one another, consider what happens when you pump air into a deflated tire. The tire’s volume first increases in direct proportion to the amount of air injected, without much increase in the tire pressure. Once the tire has expanded to nearly its full size, the walls limit volume expansion. If you continue to pump air into tire (which now has a nearly constant volume), the pressure increases with increasing temperature (see [Figure 2](#Figure_12_02_TirePressure)).

![In part (a), air is added to a tire, measured using a pressure gauge, and the tire increases in volume. In part (b), more air is added but the volume remains the same, resulting in greater pressure as indicated by the gauge. In part (c), the volume remains nearly constant, so that an increase in temperature increases the pressure.__ALT__Figure_12_02_TirePressure](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_12_02_tirepressu.jpg)
***Figure 2** (a) When air is pumped into a deflated tire, its volume first increases without much increase in pressure. (b) When the tire is filled to a certain point, the tire walls resist further expansion, and the pressure increases as more air is added. (c) Once the tire is inflated fully, its pressure increases with temperature.*

## Pressure–Volume Work
*Pressure–volume work* is the work that is done by the compression or expansion of a fluid. Whenever there is a change in volume and external pressure remains constant, pressure–volume work is taking place. During a compression, a decrease in volume increases the internal pressure of a system as work is done *on* the system. During an expansion ([Figure 3](#Figure_12_03_Expansion)), an increase in volume decreases the internal pressure of a system as the system *does* work.

![A piston in an engine cylinder with cross-sectional area A moves up a distance d as energy is added, causing the volume to expand by Ad.__ALT__Figure_12_03_Expansion](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_12_02_Expansion.jpg)
***Figure 3** An expansion of a gas requires energy transfer to keep the pressure constant. Because pressure is constant, the work done is  
.*

Recall that the formula for work is    We can rearrange the definition of pressure,    to get an expression for force in terms of pressure.


Substituting this expression for force into the definition of work, we get


Because area multiplied by displacement is the change in volume,  
, the mathematical expression for pressure–volume work is


Just as we say that work is force acting over a distance, for fluids, we can say that work is the pressure acting through the change in volume. For pressure–volume work, pressure is analogous to force, and volume is analogous to distance in the traditional definition of work.

## The First Law of Thermodynamics

Heat (*Q*) and work (*W*) are the two ways to add or remove energy from a system. The processes are very different. Heat is driven by temperature differences, while work involves a force exerted through a distance. Nevertheless, heat and work can produce identical results. For example, both can cause a temperature increase. Heat transfers energy into a system, such as when the sun warms the air in a bicycle tire and increases the air’s temperature. Similarly, work can be done on the system, as when the bicyclist pumps air into the tire. Once the temperature increase has occurred, it is impossible to tell whether it was caused by heat or work. Heat and work are both energy in transit—neither is stored as such in a system. However, both can change the internal energy, *U*, of a system.

is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of a system’s atoms and molecules. It can be divided into many subcategories, such as thermal and chemical energy, and depends only on the state of a system (that is, *P*,*V*, and *T*), not on how the energy enters or leaves the system.

In order to understand the relationship between heat, work, and internal energy, we use the . The first law of thermodynamics applies the *conservation of energy* principle to systems where heat and work are the methods of transferring energy into and out of the systems. It can also be used to describe how energy transferred by heat is converted and transferred again by work.


> Recall that the principle of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be altered from one form to another.
The first law of thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy of a closed system equals the net heat transfer *into*the system minus the net work done *by*the system. In equation form, the first law of thermodynamics is


Here,  
 is the *change in internal energy*,*U*, of the system. As shown in [Figure 4](#Figure_12_02_FirstThermo), *Q*is the *net heat transferred into the system*—that is, *Q*is the sum of all heat transfers into and out of the system. *W*is the *net work done by the system*—that is, *W*is the sum of all work done on or by the system. By convention, if *Q*is positive, then there is a net heat transfer into the system; if *W*is positive, then there is net work done by the system. So positive *Q*adds energy to the system by heat, and positive *W*takes energy from the system by work. Note that if heat transfers more energy into the system than that which is done by work, the difference is stored as internal energy.

![Q is shown adding energy to the system, while W causes energy to leave the system. For the system, the following equations are shown:__ALT__Figure_12_02_FirstThermo](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_12_02_FirstTherm.jpg)
***Figure 4** The first law of thermodynamics is the *conservation of energy* principle stated for a system, where heat and work are the methods of transferring energy to and from a system. *Q* represents the net heat transfer—it is the sum of all transfers of energy by heat into and out of the system. *Q* is positive for net heat transfer *into* the system.    is the work done *by* the system, and    is the work done *on* the system. *W* is the total work done on or *by* the system. *W* is positive when more work is done *by* the system than *on* it. The change in the internal energy of the system,  , is related to heat and work by the first law of thermodynamics:*

It follows also that negative *Q* indicates that energy is transferred *away* from the system by heat and so decreases the system’s internal energy, whereas negative *W* is work done *on* the system, which increases the internal energy.

> ### Biology: Biological Thermodynamics
> We often think about thermodynamics as being useful for inventing or testing machinery, such as engines or steam turbines. However, thermodynamics also applies to living systems, such as our own bodies. This forms the basis of the biological thermodynamics ([Figure 5](#Figure_12_02_FoodEnergy)).

> ***Figure 5** (a) The first law of thermodynamics applies to metabolism. Heat transferred out of the body (Q) and work done by the body (W) remove internal energy, whereas food intake replaces it. (Food intake may be considered work done on the body.) (b) Plants convert part of the radiant energy in sunlight into stored chemical energy, a process called *photosynthesis*.*
> 
> Life itself depends on the biological transfer of energy. Through photosynthesis, plants absorb solar energy from the sun and use this energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Photosynthesis takes in one form of energy—light—and converts it into another form—chemical potential energy (glucose and other carbohydrates).
> 
> *Human metabolism* is the conversion of food into energy given off by heat, work done by the body’s cells, and stored fat. Metabolism is an interesting example of the first law of thermodynamics in action. Eating increases the internal energy of the body by adding chemical potential energy; this is an unromantic view of a good burrito.
> 
> The body metabolizes all the food we consume. Basically, metabolism is an oxidation process in which the chemical potential energy of food is released. This implies that food input is in the form of work. Exercise helps you lose weight, because it provides energy transfer from your body by both heat and work and raises your metabolic rate even when you are at rest.
> 
> Biological thermodynamics also involves the study of transductions between cells and living organisms. *Transduction* is a process where genetic material—DNA—is transferred from one cell to another. This often occurs during a viral infection (e.g., influenza) and is how the virus spreads, namely, by transferring its genetic material to an increasing number of previously healthy cells. Once enough cells become infected, you begin to feel the effects of the virus (flu symptoms—muscle weakness, coughing, and congestion).
> 
> Energy is transferred along with the genetic material and so obeys the first law of thermodynamics. Energy is transferred—not created or destroyed—in the process. When work is done on a cell or heat transfers energy to a cell, the cell’s internal energy increases. When a cell does work or loses heat, its internal energy decreases. If the amount of work done by a cell is the same as the amount of energy transferred in by heat, or the amount of work performed on a cell matches the amount of energy transferred out by heat, there will be no net change in internal energy.
