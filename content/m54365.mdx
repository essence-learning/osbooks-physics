### The Law of Refraction

You may have noticed some odd optical phenomena when looking into a fish tank. For example, you may see the same fish appear to be in two different places ([Figure 16 02 Fish](Figure_16_02_Fish)). This is because light coming to you from the fish changes direction when it leaves the tank and, in this case, light rays traveling along two different paths both reach our eyes. The changing of a light ray’s direction (loosely called *bending*) when it passes a boundary between materials of different composition, or between layers in single material where there are changes in temperature and density, is called *refraction*. Refraction is responsible for a tremendous range of optical phenomena, from the action of lenses to voice transmission through optical fibers.

![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_16_02_Fish.jpg)<p>Looking at the fish tank as shown, we can see the same fish in two different locations, because light changes directions when it passes from water to air. In this case, light rays traveling on two different paths change direction as they travel from water to air, and so reach the observer. Consequently, the fish appears to be in two different places. This bending of light is called </p>
Why does light change direction when passing from one material (medium) to another? It is because light changes speed when going from one material to another. This behavior is typical of all waves and is especially easy to apply to light because light waves have very small wavelengths, and so they can be treated as rays. Before we study the law of refraction, it is useful to discuss the speed of light and how it varies between different media.

The speed of light is now known to great precision. In fact, the speed of light in a vacuum, *c*, is so important, and is so precisely known, that it is accepted as one of the basic physical quantities, and has the fixed value

<equation id="fs-id1164565014922"> <math display="block"> <mrow>  <mi>c</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>2.9972458</mn><mspace width="0.25em" /><mo>×</mo><mspace width="0.25em" /><msup>   <mrow>    <mn>10</mn></mrow>   <mn>8</mn>  </msup>  <mtext>m/s</mtext><mo>≈</mo><mn>3.00</mn><mspace width="0.25em" /><mo>×</mo><mspace width="0.25em" /><msup>   <mrow>    <mn>10</mn></mrow>   <mn>8</mn>  </msup>  <mtext>m/s</mtext></mrow></math> </equation>
where the approximate value of 3.00  <math> <mo>×</mo></math>  10  10<sup>8</sup> m/s is used whenever three-digit precision is sufficient. The speed of light through matter is less than it is in a vacuum, because light interacts with atoms in a material. The speed of light depends strongly on the type of material, given that its interaction with different atoms, crystal lattices, and other substructures varies. We define the **index of refraction**, *n*, of a material to be

<equation id="fs-id1167065044318" class="unnumbered"><label /> <math display="block"> <mrow>  <mi>n</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mi>c</mi>   <mi>v</mi>  </mfrac>  <mo>,</mo></mrow></math></equation>
where *v *is the observed speed of light in the material. Because the speed of light is always less than *c *in matter and equals *c *only in a vacuum, the index of refraction (plural: indices of refraction) is always greater than or equal to one.

[Table 16 02 Refractive Indices](Table_16_02_Refractive_Indices) lists the indices of refraction in various common materials.

[Figure 16 02 Lawnmower](Figure_16_02_Lawnmower) provides an analogy for and a description of how a ray of light changes direction when it passes from one medium to another. As in the previous section, the angles are measured relative to a perpendicular to the surface at the point where the light ray crosses it. The change in direction of the light ray depends on how the speed of light changes. The change in the speed of light is related to the indices of refraction of the media involved. In the situations shown in [Figure 16 02 Lawnmower](Figure_16_02_Lawnmower), medium 2 has a greater index of refraction than medium 1. This difference in index of refraction means that the speed of light is less in medium 2 than in medium 1. Note that, in [Figure 16 02 Lawnmower](Figure_16_02_Lawnmower)(a), the path of the ray moves closer to the perpendicular when the ray slows down. Conversely, in [Figure 16 02 Lawnmower](Figure_16_02_Lawnmower)(b), the path of the ray moves away from the perpendicular when the ray speeds up. The path is exactly reversible. In both cases, you can imagine what happens by thinking about pushing a lawn mower from a footpath onto grass, and vice versa. Going from the footpath to grass, the right front wheel is slowed and pulled to the side as shown. This is the same change in direction for light when it goes from a fast medium to a slow one. When going from the grass to the footpath, the left front wheel moves faster than the others, and the mower changes direction as shown. This, too, is the same change in direction as light going from slow to fast.

This is analogous to what happens when a lawnmower goes from a footpath (medium 1) to grass (medium 2). (b) A ray of light moves away from the perpendicular when it speeds up.

## Bending Light

The Bending Light simulation allows you to show light refracting as it crosses the boundaries between various media (download animation first to view). It also shows the reflected ray. You can move the protractor to the point where the light meets the boundary and measure the angle of incidence, the **angle of refraction**, and the angle of reflection. You can also insert a prism into the beam to view the spreading, or **dispersion**, of white light into colors, as discussed later in this section. Use the ray option at the upper left.

The amount that a light ray changes direction depends both on the incident angle and the amount that the speed changes. For a ray at a given incident angle, a large change in speed causes a large change in direction, and thus a large change in the angle of refraction. The exact mathematical relationship is the law of refraction, or ****, which is stated in equation form as

In terms of speeds, Snell’s law becomes

Here, *n*1 and *n*2 are the indices of refraction for media 1 and 2, respectively, and *θ*1 and *θ*2 are the angles between the rays and the perpendicular in the respective media 1 and 2, as shown in [Figure 16 02 Lawnmower](Figure_16_02_Lawnmower). The incoming ray is called the **** and the outgoing ray is called the ****. The associated angles are called the *angle of incidence* and the *angle of refraction*. Later, we apply Snell’s law to some practical situations.

Dispersion is defined as the spreading of white light into the wavelengths of which it is composed. This happens because the index of refraction varies slightly with wavelength. [Figure 16 02 Prism](Figure_16_02_Prism) shows how a prism disperses white light into the colors of the rainbow.

Rainbows are produced by a combination of refraction and reflection. You may have noticed that you see a rainbow only when you turn your back to the Sun. Light enters a drop of water and is reflected from the back of the drop, as shown in [Figure 16 02 Rainbow](Figure_16_02_Rainbow). The light is refracted both as it enters and as it leaves the drop. Because the index of refraction of water varies with wavelength, the light is dispersed and a rainbow is observed.

## Dispersion
This video explains how refraction disperses white light into its composite colors.

A good-quality mirror reflects more than 90 percent of the light that falls on it; the mirror absorbs the rest. But, it would be useful to have a mirror that reflects all the light that falls on it. Interestingly, we can produce total reflection using an aspect of refraction. Consider what happens when a ray of light strikes the surface between two materials, such as is shown in [Figure 16 02 Total internal](Figure_16_02_Total_internal)(a). Part of the light crosses the boundary and is refracted; the rest is reflected. If, as shown in the figure, the index of refraction for the second medium is less than the first, the ray bends away from the perpendicular. Because *n*1* > n*2, the angle of refraction is greater than the angle of incidence—that is,  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>θ</mi>   <mtext>2</mtext>  </msub>  </mrow></math> &gt;  > <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>θ</mi>   <mtext>1</mtext>  </msub>  </mrow></math> .

Total internal reflection occurs for any incident angle greater than the critical angle,  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>θ</mi>   <mtext>c</mtext>  </msub>  </mrow></math>, and it can only occur when the second medium has an index of refraction less than the first. Note that the previous equation is written for a light ray that travels in medium 1 and reflects from medium 2, as shown in , and it can only occur when the second medium has an index of refraction less than the first. Note that the previous equation is written for a light ray that travels in medium 1 and reflects from medium 2, as shown in [Figure 16 02 Total internal](Figure_16_02_Total_internal).

There are several important applications of total internal reflection. Total internal reflection, coupled with a large index of refraction, explains why diamonds sparkle more than other materials. The critical angle for a diamond-to-air surface is only 24.4°; so, when light enters a diamond, it has trouble getting back out ([Figure 16 02 Diamond](Figure_16_02_Diamond)). Although light freely enters the diamond at different angles, it can exit only if it makes an angle less than 24.4° with the normal to a given surface. Facets on diamonds are specifically intended to make this unlikely, so that the light can exit only in certain places. Diamonds with very few impurities are very clear, so the light makes many internal reflections and is concentrated at the few places it can exit—hence the sparkle.

![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_16_02_Diamond.jpg)<p>Light cannot escape a diamond easily because its critical angle with air is so small. Most reflections are total and the facets are placed so that light can exit only in particular ways, thus concentrating the light and making the diamond sparkle.</p>
A light ray that strikes an object that consists of two mutually perpendicular reflecting surfaces is reflected back exactly parallel to the direction from which it came. This parallel reflection is true whenever the reflecting surfaces are perpendicular, and it is independent of the angle of incidence. Such an object is called a **** because the light bounces from its inside corner. Many inexpensive reflector buttons on bicycles, cars, and warning signs have corner reflectors designed to return light in the direction from which it originates. Corner reflectors are perfectly efficient when the conditions for total internal reflection are satisfied. With common materials, it is easy to obtain a critical angle that is less than 45°. One use of these perfect *mirrors* is in binoculars, as shown in [Figure 16 02 Binoculars](Figure_16_02_Binoculars). Another application is for periscopes used in submarines.

![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_16_02_Binoculars.jpg)<p>These binoculars use corner reflectors with total internal reflection to get light to the observer’s eyes.</p>
Fiber optics are one common application of total internal reflection. In communications, fiber optics are used to transmit telephone, internet, and cable TV signals, and they use the transmission of light down fibers of plastic or glass. Because the fibers are thin, light entering one is likely to strike the inside surface at an angle greater than the critical angle and, thus, be totally reflected ([Figure 16 02 Fiber](Figure_16_02_Fiber)). The index of refraction outside the fiber must be smaller than inside, a condition that is satisfied easily by coating the outside of the fiber with a material that has an appropriate refractive index. In fact, most fibers have a varying refractive index to allow more light to be guided along the fiber through total internal reflection. Rays are reflected around corners as shown in the figure, making the fibers into tiny *light pipes*.

![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_16_02_Fiber.jpg)<p>(a) Fibers in bundles are clad by a material that has a lower index of refraction than the core to ensure total internal reflection, even when fibers are in contact with one another. A single fiber with its cladding is shown. (b) Light entering a thin fiber may strike the inside surface at large, or grazing, angles, and is completely reflected if these angles exceed the critical angle. Such rays continue down the fiber, even following it around corners, because the angles of reflection and incidence remain large.</p>
## Medicine: Endoscopes
A medical device called an *endoscope* is shown in [Figure 16 02 Endoscope](Figure_16_02_Endoscope).

![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_16_02_Endoscope.jpg)<p>Endoscopes, such as the one drawn here, send light down a flexible fiber optic tube, which sends images back to a doctor in charge of performing a medical procedure.</p>
The word *endoscope means looking inside*. Doctors use endoscopes to look inside hollow organs in the human body and inside body cavities. These devices are used to diagnose internal physical problems. Images may be transmitted to an eyepiece or sent to a video screen. Another channel is sometimes included to allow the use of small surgical instruments. Such surgical procedures include collecting biopsies for later testing, and removing polyps and other growths.

<equation id="fs-id1164565195530"> <math display="block"> <mrow>  <mi>n</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mi>c</mi>   <mi>v</mi>  </mfrac>  <mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mrow>    <mn>3.00</mn><mspace width="0.25em" /><mo>×</mo><mspace width="0.25em" /><msup>     <mrow>      <mn>10</mn></mrow>     <mn>8</mn>    </msup>    <mtext>m/s</mtext></mrow>   <mrow>    <mn>2.012</mn><mspace width="0.25em" /><mo>×</mo><mspace width="0.25em" /><msup>     <mrow>      <mn>10</mn></mrow>     <mn>8</mn>    </msup>    <mtext>m/s</mtext></mrow>  </mfrac>  <mo>=</mo><mn>1.49</mn></mrow></math></equation>
This value matches that of polystyrene exactly, according to the table of indices of refraction ([Table 16 02 Refractive Indices](Table_16_02_Refractive_Indices)).

## Discussion
The three-digit approximation for *c* is used, which in this case is all that is needed. Many values in the table are only given to three significant figures. Note that the units for speed cancel to yield a dimensionless answer, which is correct.

## Calculating Index of Refraction from Angles
Suppose you have an unknown, clear solid substance immersed in water and you wish to identify it by finding its index of refraction. You arrange to have a beam of light enter it at an angle of 45.00°, and you observe the angle of refraction to be 40.30°. What are the index of refraction of the substance and its likely identity?

## Strategy
We must use the mathematical expression for the law of refraction to solve this problem because we are given angle data, not speed data.

<equation id="fs-id1164564829480"> <math display="block"> <mrow>  <mfrac>   <mrow>    <msub>     <mi>n</mi>     <mn>1</mn>    </msub>    </mrow>   <mrow>    <msub>     <mi>n</mi>     <mn>2</mn>    </msub>    </mrow>  </mfrac>  <mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mrow>    <mtext>sin</mtext><msub>     <mi>θ</mi>     <mn>2</mn>    </msub>    </mrow>   <mrow>    <mtext>sin</mtext><msub>     <mi>θ</mi>     <mn>1</mn>    </msub>    </mrow>  </mfrac>  </mrow></math></equation>
The subscripts 1 and 2 refer to values for water and the unknown, respectively, where 1 represents the medium from which the light is coming and 2 is the new medium it is entering. We are given the angle values, and the table of indicies of refraction gives us *n* for water as 1.333. All we have to do before solving the problem is rearrange the equation

<equation id="fs-id1164566941978"> <math display="block"> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>n</mi>   <mn>2</mn>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mrow>    <msub>     <mi>n</mi>     <mn>1</mn>    </msub>    <mtext>sin</mtext><msub>     <mi>θ</mi>     <mn>1</mn>    </msub>    </mrow>   <mrow>    <mtext>sin</mtext><msub>     <mi>θ</mi>     <mn>2</mn>    </msub>    </mrow>  </mfrac>  <mo>.</mo></mrow></math></equation>
## Solution
<equation id="fs-id1164564910076"> <math display="block"> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>n</mi>   <mn>2</mn>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mrow>    <mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1.333</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>0.7071</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow>   <mrow>    <mn>0.6468</mn></mrow>  </mfrac>  <mo>=</mo><mn>1.457</mn></mrow></math></equation>
The best match from [Table 16 02 Refractive Indices](Table_16_02_Refractive_Indices) is fused quartz, with *n* = 1.458.

## Discussion
Note the relative sizes of the variables involved. For example, a larger angle has a larger sine value. This checks out for the two angles involved. Note that the smaller value of  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>θ</mi>   <mtext>2</mtext>  </msub>  </mrow></math>  compared with    compared with  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>θ</mi>   <mtext>1</mtext>  </msub>  </mrow></math>  indicates the ray has bent   indicates the ray has bent *toward* normal. This result is to be expected if the unknown substance has a greater *n* value than that of water. The result shows that this is the case.

## Calculating Critical Angle
Verify that the critical angle for light going from water to air is 48.6°. (See [Table 16 02 Refractive Indices](Table_16_02_Refractive_Indices), the table of indices of refraction.)

## Strategy
First, choose the equation for critical angle

<equation id="fs-id1164563564864"> <math display="block"> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>θ</mi>   <mi>c</mi>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo><msup>   <mrow>    <mi>sin</mi></mrow>   <mrow>    <mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow>  </msup>  <mrow><mo>(</mo>   <mrow>    <mfrac>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>n</mi>       <mn>2</mn>      </msub>      </mrow>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>n</mi>       <mn>1</mn>      </msub>      </mrow>    </mfrac>    </mrow>  <mo>)</mo></mrow><mtext>, for </mtext><msub>   <mi>n</mi>   <mn>1</mn>  </msub>  <mo>&gt;</mo><msub>   <mi>n</mi>   <mn>2</mn>  </msub>  <mo>.</mo></mrow></math></equation>
Then, look up the *n* values for water, *n*1, and air, *n*2. Find the value of
 <math><mfrac>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>n</mi>       <mn>2</mn>      </msub>      </mrow>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>n</mi>       <mn>1</mn>      </msub>      </mrow>    </mfrac></math> . Last, find the angle that has a sine equal to this value and it compare with the given angle of 48.6°. . Last, find the angle that has a sine equal to this value and it compare with the given angle of 48.6°.

## Solution
For water, *n*1 = 1.333; for air, *n*2 = 1.0003. So,

<equation id="fs-id1164562164023"> <math display="block"> <mtable columnalign="left">  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mfrac>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>n</mi>       <mn>2</mn>      </msub>      </mrow>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>n</mi>       <mn>1</mn>      </msub>      </mrow>    </mfrac>    <mo>=</mo><mfrac>     <mrow>      <mn>1.0003</mn></mrow>     <mrow>      <mn>1.333</mn></mrow>    </mfrac>    <mo>=</mo><mn>0.7504</mn>   </mtd>  </mtr>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <msup>     <mi>sin</mi>     <mrow>      <mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow>    </msup>    <mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>0.7504</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>48.63°</mn><mo /><mo>.</mo>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></equation>
## Discussion
Remember, when we try to find a critical angle, we look for the angle at which light can no longer escape past a medium boundary by refraction. It is logical, then, to think of subscript 1 as referring to the medium the light is trying to leave, and subscript 2 as where it is trying (unsuccessfully) to go. So water is 1 and air is 2.

Water floats on a liquid called *carbon tetrachloride*. The two liquids do not mix. A light ray passing from water into carbon tetrachloride has an incident angle of 45.0° and an angle of refraction of 40.1°. If the index of refraction of water is 1.33, what is the index of refraction of carbon tetrachloride?

Describe what happens to a light ray when it is refracted. Include in your explanation comparison of angles, comparison of refractive indices, and the term *normal*.

1. When a ray of light goes from one medium to another medium with a different refractive index, the ray changes its path as a result of interference. The angle between the ray and the normal (the line perpendicular to the surfaces of the two media) is greater in the medium with the greater refractive index.
2. When a ray of light goes from one medium to another medium with a different refractive index, the ray changes its path as a result of refraction. The angle between the ray and the normal (the line perpendicular to the surfaces of the two media) is less in the medium with the greater refractive index.
3. When a ray of light goes from one medium to another medium with a different refractive index, the ray does not change its path. The angle between the ray and the normal (the line parallel to the surfaces of the two media) is the same in both media.
4. When a ray of light goes from one medium to another medium with a different refractive index, the ray changes its path as a result of refraction. The angle between the ray and the normal (the line perpendicular to the surfaces of the two media) is less in the medium with the lower refractive index.

Describe total internal reflection. Include a definition of the critical angle and how it is related to total internal reflection. Also, compare the indices of refraction of the interior material and the surrounding material.

1. When the interior material has a smaller index of refraction than the surrounding material, the incident ray may approach the boundary at an angle (called the *critical angle*) such that the refraction angle is 90° . The refracted ray cannot leave the interior, so it is reflected back inside and total internal reflection occurs.
2. When the interior material has a smaller index of refraction than the surrounding material, the incident ray may approach the boundary at an angle (called the *critical angle*) such that the refraction angle is less than 90° . The refracted ray cannot leave the interior, so it is reflected back inside and total internal reflection occurs.
3. When the interior material has the same index of refraction as the surrounding material, the incident ray approaches the boundary at an angle (called the *critical angle*) such that the refraction angle is less than 90° . The refracted ray cannot leave the interior, so it is reflected back inside and total internal reflection occurs.
4. When the interior material has a greater index of refraction than the surrounding material, the incident ray may approach the boundary at an angle (called the *critical angle*) such that the refraction angle is 90° . The refracted ray cannot leave the interior, so it is reflected back inside and total internal reflection occurs.
