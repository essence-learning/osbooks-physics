<table><tr><td>electric power</td></tr></table>
Power is associated by many people with electricity. Every day, we use electric power to run our modern appliances. Electric power transmission lines are visible examples of electricity providing power. We also use electric power to start our cars, to run our computers, or to light our homes. Power is the rate at which energy of any type is transferred;  is the rate at which electric energy is transferred in a circuit. In this section, we’ll learn not only what this means, but also what factors determine electric power.

To get started, let’s think of light bulbs, which are often characterized in terms of their power ratings in watts. Let us compare a 25-W bulb with a 60-W bulb (see [Figure 1](#Figure_19_04_Light_bulb)). Although both operate at the same voltage, the 60-W bulb emits more light intensity than the 25-W bulb. This tells us that something other than voltage determines the power output of an electric circuit.

Incandescent light bulbs, such as the two shown in [Figure 1](#Figure_19_04_Light_bulb), are essentially resistors that heat up when current flows through them and they get so hot that they emit visible and invisible light. Thus the two light bulbs in the photo can be considered as two different resistors. In a simple circuit such as a light bulb with a voltage applied to it, the resistance determines the current by Ohm’s law, so we can see that current as well as voltage must determine the power.

***Figure 1** On the left is a 25-W light bulb, and on the right is a 60-W light bulb. Why are their power outputs different despite their operating on the same voltage?*

The formula for power may be found by dimensional analysis. Consider the units of power. In the SI system, power is given in watts (W), which is energy per unit time, or J/s

Recall now that a voltage is the potential energy per unit charge, which means that voltage has units of J/C

But a Coulomb per second (C/s) is an electric current, which we can see from the definition of electric current,  <math> <mrow>  <mi>I</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mrow>    <mi>Δ</mi><mi>Q</mi></mrow>   <mrow>    <mi>Δ</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow>  </mfrac>  </mrow></math>, where  , where  <math> <mi>Δ</mi></math>    *Q* is the charge in coulombs and  <math> <mi>Δ</mi></math>    *t* is time in seconds. Thus, equation above tells us that electric power is voltage times current, or

<equation id="fs-id1167062551057" class="unnumbered"><label /> <math> <mrow>  <mi>P</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>I</mi><mi>V</mi><mtext>.</mtext></mrow></math> </equation>
This equation gives the electric power consumed by a circuit with a voltage drop of *V* and a current of *I*.

For example, consider the circuit in [Figure 2](#Figure_19_04_Circuit15). From Ohm’s law, the current running through the circuit is

<equation id="fs-id1164564906771"> <math display="block"> <mrow>  <mi>I</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mi>V</mi>   <mi>R</mi>  </mfrac>  <mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mrow>    <mn>12</mn><mspace width="0.3em" /><mtext>V</mtext></mrow>   <mrow>    <mn>100</mn><mspace width="0.3em" /><mtext>Ω</mtext></mrow>  </mfrac>  <mo>=</mo><mn>0.12</mn><mspace width="0.3em" /><mtext>A.</mtext></mrow></math> </equation>
Thus, the power consumed by the circuit is

<equation id="fs-id1164562444295"> <math display="block"> <mrow>  <mi>P</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>V</mi><mi>I</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo>   <mrow>    <mn>12</mn><mspace width="0.3em" /><mtext>V</mtext></mrow>  <mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo>   <mrow>    <mn>0.12</mn><mspace width="0.3em" /><mtext>A</mtext></mrow>  <mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>1.4</mn><mspace width="0.3em" /><mtext>W.</mtext></mrow></math> </equation>
Where does this power go? In this circuit, the power goes primarily into heating the resistor in this circuit.

***Figure 2** A simple circuit that consumes electric power.*

In calculating the power in the circuit of [Figure 2](#Figure_19_04_Circuit15), we used the resistance and Ohm’s law to find the current. Ohm’s law gives the current: <math> <mrow>  <mi>I</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>/</mo><mi>R</mi></mrow>  </mrow></math>, which we can insert into the equation for electric power to obtain, which we can insert into the equation for electric power to obtain

This gives the power in terms of only the voltage and the resistance.

We can also use Ohm’s law to eliminate the voltage in the equation for electric power and obtain an expression for power in terms of just the current and the resistance. If we write Ohm’s law as  <math> <mrow>  <mi>V</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>I</mi><mi>R</mi></mrow></math>  and use this to eliminate  
 and use this to eliminate *V* in the equation  <math> <mrow>  <mi>P</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>I</mi><mi>V</mi></mrow></math>, we obtain, we obtain

<equation id="fs-id1167064749730" class="unnumbered"><label /> <math> <mrow>  <mi>P</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>I</mi><mi>V</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>I</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo>   <mrow>    <mi>I</mi><mi>R</mi></mrow>  <mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><msup>   <mi>I</mi>   <mn>2</mn>  </msup>  <mi>R</mi><mtext>.</mtext></mrow></math> </equation>
This gives the power in terms of only the current and the resistance.

Thus, by combining Ohm’s law with the equation  <math> <mrow>  <mi>P</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>I</mi><mi>V</mi></mrow></math>  for electric power, we obtain two more expressions for power: one in terms of voltage and resistance and one in terms of current and resistance. Note that only resistance (not capacitance or anything else), current, and voltage enter into the expressions for electric power. This means that the physical characteristic of a circuit that determines how much power it dissipates is its resistance. Any capacitors in the circuit do not dissipate electric power—on the contrary, capacitors either store electric energy or release electric energy back to the circuit.  for electric power, we obtain two more expressions for power: one in terms of voltage and resistance and one in terms of current and resistance.

To clarify how voltage, resistance, current, and power are all related, consider [Figure 3](#Figure_19_04_Wheel), which shows the *formula wheel*. The quantities in the center quarter circle are equal to the quantities in the corresponding outer quarter circle. For example, to express a potential V in terms of power and current, we see from the formula wheel that  <math> <mrow>  <mi>V</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>/</mo><mi>I</mi></mrow>  </mrow></math> . .
