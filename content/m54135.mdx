## Defining Force and Dynamics

is the cause of motion, and motion draws our attention. Motion itself can be beautiful, such as a dolphin jumping out of the water, the flight of a bird, or the orbit of a satellite. The study of motion is called , but kinematics describes only the way objects move—their  and their .  considers the forces that affect the motion of moving objects and .  are the foundation of dynamics. These laws describe the way objects speed up, slow down, stay in motion, and interact with other objects. They are also : they apply everywhere on Earth as well as in space.

A force pushes or pulls an object. The object being moved by a force could be an inanimate object, a table, or an animate object, a person. The pushing or pulling may be done by a person, or even the gravitational pull of Earth. Forces have different magnitudes and directions; this means that some forces are stronger than others and can act in different directions. For example, a cannon exerts a strong force on the cannonball that is launched into the air. In contrast, a mosquito landing on your arm exerts only a small force on your arm.

When multiple forces act on an object, the forces combine. Adding together all of the forces acting on an object gives the total force, or . An  is a force that acts on an object within the system *from outside* the system. This type of force is different than an internal force, which acts between two objects that are both within the system.  combines these two definitions; it is the total combined external force. We discuss further details about net force, external force, and net external force in the coming sections.

Like displacements, velocities, and accelerations, forces are vectors that have magnitude and direction. We may represent a force as the sum of two vectors at right angles. These are its one-dimensional components, which we can represent by a signed scalar quantity. When we do so, we must choose a coordinate system and the direction along each axis that will be the positive direction. This choice must be the same for all vectors in the problem—forces, accelerations, etc.

Commonly, in a problem set in a vertical plane, horizontal and vertical axes are chosen as the two primary directions. The usual convention is to make the positive directions right and up. Sometimes a problem concerns a sloping plane, and it may be more convenient to choose axes parallel to the plane and normal to it. In this case, it is usual to take positive in each axis as the directions that tend upward.

Thus, a horizontal force of –3 N means pushing with 3 N to the left.

Unknown values are taken to be in the positive direction, so if your calculation of a vertical force comes out as +5.2 N, then you know it is an upward force. A negative result means the force is downward.

## Free-Body Diagrams and Examples of Forces

For our first example of force, consider an object hanging from a rope. This example gives us the opportunity to introduce a useful tool known as a . A free-body diagram represents the object being acted upon—that is, the free body—as a single point. Only the forces acting *on* the body (that is, external forces) are shown and are represented by vectors (which are drawn as arrows). These forces are the only ones shown because only external forces acting on the body affect its motion. We can ignore any internal forces within the body because they cancel each other out, as explained in the section on Newton’s third law of motion. Free-body diagrams are very useful for analyzing forces acting on an object.

![An object labeled m for mass is attached to a rope. A force vector labeled T for tension is pointing upward from the object and a force vector labeled W for weight of the object is pointing downward from the object. A free body diagram illustrates the T and W force vectors.__ALT__Figure_04_01_tension](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_04_01_tension.jpg)
***Figure 1** An object of mass, *m*, is held up by the force of tension.*

[Figure 1](#Figure_04_01_tension) shows the force of tension in the rope acting in the upward direction, opposite the force of gravity. The forces are indicated in the free-body diagram by an arrow pointing up, representing tension, and another arrow pointing down, representing gravity. In a free-body diagram, the lengths of the arrows show the relative magnitude (or strength) of the forces. Because forces are vectors, they add just like other vectors. Notice that the two arrows have equal lengths in [Figure 1](#Figure_04_01_tension), which means that the forces of tension and weight are of equal magnitude. Because these forces of equal magnitude act in opposite directions, they are perfectly balanced, so they add together to give a net force of zero.

Not all forces are as noticeable as when you push or pull on an object. Some forces act without physical contact, such as the pull of a magnet (in the case of magnetic force) or the gravitational pull of Earth (in the case of gravitational force).

In the next three sections discussing Newton’s laws of motion, we will learn about three specific types of forces: friction, the , and the . To analyze situations involving forces, we will create free-body diagrams to organize the framework of the mathematics for each individual situation.

> Correctly drawing and labeling a free-body diagram is an important first step for solving a problem. It will help you visualize the problem and correctly apply the mathematics to solve the problem.
## Section Summary
* Dynamics is the study of how forces affect the motion of objects and systems.
* Force is a push or pull that can be defined in terms of various standards. It is a vector and so has both magnitude and direction.
* External forces are any forces outside of a body that act on the body. A free-body diagram is a drawing of all external forces acting on a body.
