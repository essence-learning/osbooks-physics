### Wave Variables

In the chapter on motion in two dimensions, we defined the following variables to describe harmonic motion:

* Amplitude—maximum displacement from the equilibrium position of an object oscillating around such equilibrium position
* Frequency—number of events per unit of time
* Period—time it takes to complete one oscillation

For waves, these variables have the same basic meaning. However, it is helpful to word the definitions in a more specific way that applies directly to waves:

* Amplitude—distance between the resting position and the maximum displacement of the wave
* Frequency—number of waves passing by a specific point per second
* Period—time it takes for one wave cycle to complete

In addition to amplitude, frequency, and period, their wavelength and wave velocity also characterize waves. The **wavelength**  <math> <mi>λ</mi></math>  is the distance between adjacent identical parts of a wave, parallel to the direction of propagation. The   is the distance between adjacent identical parts of a wave, parallel to the direction of propagation. The **wave velocity**  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>v</mi>   <mi>w</mi>  </msub> </mrow></math>  is the speed at which the disturbance moves.  is the speed at which the disturbance moves.

Wave velocity is sometimes also called the *propagation velocity *or* propagation speed* because the disturbance propagates from one location to another.

Consider the periodic water wave in [Figure 13 02 Simple2](Figure_13_02_Simple2). Its wavelength is the distance from crest to crest or from trough to trough. The wavelength can also be thought of as the distance a wave has traveled after one complete cycle—or one period. The time for one complete up-and-down motion is the simple water wave’s period *T*. In the figure, the wave itself moves to the right with a wave velocity *v*w. Its amplitude *X* is the distance between the resting position and the maximum displacement—either the crest or the trough—of the wave. It is important to note that this movement of the wave is actually the *disturbance* moving to the right, not the water itself; otherwise, the bird would move to the right. Instead, the seagull bobs up and down in place as waves pass underneath, traveling a total distance of 2*X* in one cycle. However, as mentioned in the text feature on surfing, actual ocean waves are more complex than this simplified example.

## Amplitude, Period, Frequency, and Wavelength of Periodic Waves
This video is a continuation of the video “Introduction to Waves” from the "Types of Waves" section. It discusses the properties of a periodic wave: amplitude, period, frequency, wavelength, and wave velocity.


The crest of a wave is sometimes also called the *peak*.

### The Relationship between Wave Frequency, Period, Wavelength, and Velocity

Since wave frequency is the number of waves per second, and the period is essentially the number of seconds per wave, the relationship between frequency and period is

<equation id="fs-id1164564807684"> <math display="block"> <mrow>  <mi>f</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mn>1</mn>   <mi>T</mi>  </mfrac> </mrow></math></equation>
or

<equation id="fs-id1164566851770"> <math display="block"> <mrow>  <mi>T</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mn>1</mn>   <mi>f</mi>  </mfrac>  <mo>,</mo></mrow></math></equation>
just as in the case of harmonic motion of an object. We can see from this relationship that a higher frequency means a shorter period. Recall that the unit for frequency is hertz (Hz), and that 1 Hz is one cycle—or one wave—per second.

The speed of propagation *v*w is the distance the wave travels in a given time, which is one wavelength in a time of one period. In equation form, it is written as

<equation id="fs-id1164566836508"> <math display="block"> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>v</mi>   <mi>w</mi>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mi>λ</mi>   <mi>T</mi>  </mfrac> </mrow></math> </equation>
or

<equation id="fs-id1164563568005"> <math display="block"> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>v</mi>   <mi>w</mi>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo><mi>f</mi><mi>λ</mi><mtext>.</mtext> </mrow></math></equation>
From this relationship, we see that in a medium where *v*w is constant, the higher the frequency, the smaller the wavelength. See [Figure 13 02 Speaker](Figure_13_02_Speaker).

![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_13_02_Speaker.jpg)<p>Because they travel at the same speed in a given medium, low-frequency sounds must have a greater wavelength than high-frequency sounds. Here, the lower-frequency sounds are emitted by the large speaker, called a woofer, while the higher-frequency sounds are emitted by the small speaker, called a tweeter. </p>
These fundamental relationships hold true for all types of waves. As an example, for water waves, *v*w is the speed of a surface wave; for sound, *v*w is the speed of sound; and for visible light, *v*w is the speed of light. The amplitude *X* is completely independent of the speed of propagation *v*w and depends only on the amount of energy in the wave.

> ## Waves in a Bowl
> In this lab, you will take measurements to determine how the amplitude and the period of waves are affected by the transfer of energy from a cork dropped into the water. The cork initially has some potential energy when it is held above the water—the greater the height, the higher the potential energy. When it is dropped, such potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as the cork falls. When the cork hits the water, that energy travels through the water in waves.

## Geology: Physics of Seismic Waves
![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HsPhysics_13_02_Earthquake.jpg)<p>The destructive effect of an earthquake is a palpable evidence of the energy carried in the earthquake waves. The Richter scale rating of earthquakes is related to both their amplitude and the energy they carry. (Petty Officer 2nd Class Candice Villarreal, U.S. Navy)</p>
Geologists rely heavily on physics to study earthquakes since earthquakes involve several types of wave disturbances, including disturbance of Earth’s surface and pressure disturbances under the surface. Surface earthquake waves are similar to surface waves on water. The waves under Earth’s surface have both longitudinal and transverse components. The longitudinal waves in an earthquake are called pressure waves (P-waves) and the transverse waves are called shear waves (S-waves). These two types of waves propagate at different speeds, and the speed at which they travel depends on the rigidity of the medium through which they are traveling. During earthquakes, the speed of P-waves in granite is significantly higher than the speed of S-waves. Both components of earthquakes travel more slowly in less rigid materials, such as sediments. P-waves have speeds of 4 to 7 km/s, and S-waves have speeds of 2 to 5 km/s, but both are faster in more rigid materials. The P-wave gets progressively farther ahead of the S-wave as they travel through Earth’s crust. For that reason, the time difference between the P- and S-waves is used to determine the distance to their source, the epicenter of the earthquake.

We know from seismic waves produced by earthquakes that parts of the interior of Earth are liquid. Shear or transverse waves cannot travel through a liquid and are not transmitted through Earth’s core. In contrast, compression or longitudinal waves can pass through a liquid and they do go through the core.

All waves carry energy, and the energy of earthquake waves is easy to observe based on the amount of damage left behind after the ground has stopped moving. Earthquakes can shake whole cities to the ground, performing the work of thousands of wrecking balls. The amount of energy in a wave is related to its amplitude. Large-amplitude earthquakes produce large ground displacements and greater damage. As earthquake waves spread out, their amplitude decreases, so there is less damage the farther they get from the source.

What is the relationship between the propagation speed, frequency, and wavelength of the S-waves in an earthquake?

## Wave on a String

In this animation, watch how a string vibrates in slow motion by choosing the Slow Motion setting. Select the No End and Manual options, and wiggle the end of the string to make waves yourself. Then switch to the Oscillate setting to generate waves automatically. Adjust the frequency and the amplitude of the oscillations to see what happens. Then experiment with adjusting the damping and the tension.

Which of the settingsamplitude, frequency, damping, or tensionchanges the amplitude of the wave as it propagates? What does it do to the amplitude?

1. Frequency; it decreases the amplitude of the wave as it propagates.
2. Frequency; it increases the amplitude of the wave as it propagates.
3. Damping; it decreases the amplitude of the wave as it propagates.
4. Damping; it increases the amplitude of the wave as it propagates.

## Discussion
This slow speed seems reasonable for an ocean wave. Note that in the figure, the wave moves to the right at this speed, which is different from the varying speed at which the seagull bobs up and down.
