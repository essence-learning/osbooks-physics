## Wave Variables
In the chapter on motion in two dimensions, we defined the following variables to describe harmonic motion:

* Amplitude—maximum displacement from the equilibrium position of an object oscillating around such equilibrium position
* Frequency—number of events per unit of time
* Period—time it takes to complete one oscillation
For waves, these variables have the same basic meaning. However, it is helpful to word the definitions in a more specific way that applies directly to waves:

* Amplitude—distance between the resting position and the maximum displacement of the wave
* Frequency—number of waves passing by a specific point per second
* Period—time it takes for one wave cycle to complete
In addition to amplitude, frequency, and period, their wavelength and wave velocity also characterize waves. The     is the distance between adjacent identical parts of a wave, parallel to the direction of propagation. The     is the speed at which the disturbance moves.

> Wave velocity is sometimes also called the *propagation velocity*or*propagation speed* because the disturbance propagates from one location to another.
Consider the periodic water wave in [Figure 1](#Figure_13_02_Simple2). Its wavelength is the distance from crest to crest or from trough to trough. The wavelength can also be thought of as the distance a wave has traveled after one complete cycle—or one period. The time for one complete up-and-down motion is the simple water wave’s period *T*. In the figure, the wave itself moves to the right with a wave velocity *v*. Its amplitude *X* is the distance between the resting position and the maximum displacement—either the crest or the trough—of the wave. It is important to note that this movement of the wave is actually the *disturbance* moving to the right, not the water itself; otherwise, the bird would move to the right. Instead, the seagull bobs up and down in place as waves pass underneath, traveling a total distance of 2*X* in one cycle. However, as mentioned in the text feature on surfing, actual ocean waves are more complex than this simplified example.

![A seagull bobs up and down on a sinusoidal-shaped periodic ocean wave with a given wave velocity of νw. The wavelength λ is shown as the distance from one crest to the next crest. The amplitude X is shown as the distance between the resting position and the crest. The total distance traveled by the seagull in one cycle or period is shown as 2X.__ALT__Figure_13_02_Simple2](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_13_02_Simple2.jpg)
***Figure 1** The wave has a wavelength *λ*, which is the distance between adjacent identical parts of the wave. The up-and-down disturbance of the surface propagates parallel to the surface at a speed v.*

## The Relationship between Wave Frequency, Period, Wavelength, and Velocity
Since wave frequency is the number of waves per second, and the period is essentially the number of seconds per wave, the relationship between frequency and period is


or


just as in the case of harmonic motion of an object. We can see from this relationship that a higher frequency means a shorter period. Recall that the unit for frequency is hertz (Hz), and that 1 Hz is one cycle—or one wave—per second.

The speed of propagation *v* is the distance the wave travels in a given time, which is one wavelength in a time of one period. In equation form, it is written as


or


From this relationship, we see that in a medium where *v* is constant, the higher the frequency, the smaller the wavelength. See [Figure 2](#Figure_13_02_Speaker).

![A smaller speaker emits a high-frequency sound wave with a small wavelength, while a larger speaker emits a lower-frequency sound wave with a larger wavelength.__ALT__Figure_13_02_Speaker](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_13_02_Speaker.jpg)
***Figure 2** Because they travel at the same speed in a given medium, low-frequency sounds must have a greater wavelength than high-frequency sounds. Here, the lower-frequency sounds are emitted by the large speaker, called a woofer, while the higher-frequency sounds are emitted by the small speaker, called a tweeter.*


These fundamental relationships hold true for all types of waves. As an example, for water waves, *v* is the speed of a surface wave; for sound, *v* is the speed of sound; and for visible light, *v* is the speed of light. The amplitude *X* is completely independent of the speed of propagation *v* and depends only on the amount of energy in the wave.

> ### Waves in a Bowl
> In this lab, you will take measurements to determine how the amplitude and the period of waves are affected by the transfer of energy from a cork dropped into the water. The cork initially has some potential energy when it is held above the water—the greater the height, the higher the potential energy. When it is dropped, such potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as the cork falls. When the cork hits the water, that energy travels through the water in waves.

> #### Procedure
> * Fill a large bowl or basin with water and wait for the water to settle so there are no ripples.
> * Gently drop a cork into the middle of the bowl.
> * Estimate the wavelength and the period of oscillation of the water wave that propagates away from the cork. You can estimate the period by counting the number of ripples from the center to the edge of the bowl while your partner times it. This information, combined with the bowl measurement, will give you the wavelength when the correct formula is used.
> * Remove the cork from the bowl and wait for the water to settle again.
> * Gently drop the cork at a height that is different from the first drop.
> * Repeat Steps 3 to 5 to collect a second and third set of data, dropping the cork from different heights and recording the resulting wavelengths and periods.
> * Interpret your results.

> ***Figure 3** The destructive effect of an earthquake is a palpable evidence of the energy carried in the earthquake waves. The Richter scale rating of earthquakes is related to both their amplitude and the energy they carry. (Petty Officer 2nd Class Candice Villarreal, U.S. Navy)*
> 
> Geologists rely heavily on physics to study earthquakes since earthquakes involve several types of wave disturbances, including disturbance of Earth’s surface and pressure disturbances under the surface. Surface earthquake waves are similar to surface waves on water. The waves under Earth’s surface have both longitudinal and transverse components. The longitudinal waves in an earthquake are called pressure waves (P-waves) and the transverse waves are called shear waves (S-waves). These two types of waves propagate at different speeds, and the speed at which they travel depends on the rigidity of the medium through which they are traveling. During earthquakes, the speed of P-waves in granite is significantly higher than the speed of S-waves. Both components of earthquakes travel more slowly in less rigid materials, such as sediments. P-waves have speeds of 4 to 7 km/s, and S-waves have speeds of 2 to 5 km/s, but both are faster in more rigid materials. The P-wave gets progressively farther ahead of the S-wave as they travel through Earth’s crust. For that reason, the time difference between the P- and S-waves is used to determine the distance to their source, the epicenter of the earthquake.
> 
> We know from seismic waves produced by earthquakes that parts of the interior of Earth are liquid. Shear or transverse waves cannot travel through a liquid and are not transmitted through Earth’s core. In contrast, compression or longitudinal waves can pass through a liquid and they do go through the core.
> 
> All waves carry energy, and the energy of earthquake waves is easy to observe based on the amount of damage left behind after the ground has stopped moving. Earthquakes can shake whole cities to the ground, performing the work of thousands of wrecking balls. The amount of energy in a wave is related to its amplitude. Large-amplitude earthquakes produce large ground displacements and greater damage. As earthquake waves spread out, their amplitude decreases, so there is less damage the farther they get from the source.
