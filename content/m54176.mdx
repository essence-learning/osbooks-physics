## Angle of Rotation
What exactly do we mean by *circular motion* or *rotation*?  is the circular motion of an object about an axis of rotation. We will discuss specifically circular motion and spin.  is when an object moves in a circular path. Examples of circular motion include a race car speeding around a circular curve, a toy attached to a string swinging in a circle around your head, or the circular *loop-the-loop* on a roller coaster.  is rotation about an axis that goes through the center of mass of the object, such as Earth rotating on its axis, a wheel turning on its axle, the spin of a tornado on its path of destruction, or a figure skater spinning during a performance at the Olympics. Sometimes, objects will be spinning while in circular motion, like the Earth spinning on its axis while revolving around the Sun, but we will focus on these two motions separately.


When solving problems involving rotational motion, we use variables that are similar to linear variables (distance, velocity, acceleration, and force) but take into account the curvature or rotation of the motion. Here, we define the , which is the angular equivalence of distance; and , which is the angular equivalence of linear velocity.

When objects rotate about some axis—for example, when the CD in [Figure 1](#Figure_06_01_CD) rotates about its center—each point in the object follows a circular path.

![The diagram shows a picture of a CD with about an eighth of the shiny surface peeled away to display the inside of the CD with pits (dots) arranged in lines from the center. An angle theta is marked from one line of dots to another.__ALT__Figure_06_01_CD](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_06_01_CD.jpg)
***Figure 1** All points on a CD travel in circular paths. The pits (dots) along a line from the center to the edge all move through the same angle    in time   .*

The , **Δ*s***, is the distance traveled along a circular path. The ,****r**, is the radius of the circular path. Both are shown in [Figure 2](#Figure_06_01_RotationAngle).

![The diagram shows a circle with the center marked O, a radius r ending on the circumference at A, an arc change of s starting at A and ending at B. The angle for the arc is change of theta. A formula to the right of the circle says change of theta is equal to change of s divided by r.__ALT__Figure_06_01_RotationAngle](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_06_01_RotationAn.jpg)
***Figure 2** The radius (*r*) of a circle is rotated through an angle   . The arc length,  , is the distance covered along the circumference.*

Consider a line from the center of the CD to its edge. In a given time, each *pit* (used to record information) on this line moves through the same angle. The angle of rotation is the amount of rotation and is the angular analog of distance. The angle of rotation    is the arc length divided by the radius of curvature.


The angle of rotation is often measured by using a unit called the . (Radians are actually dimensionless, because a radian is defined as the ratio of two distances, radius and arc length.) A  is one complete rotation, where every point on the circle returns to its original position. One revolution covers    radians (or 360 degrees), and therefore has an angle of rotation of    radians, and an arc length that is the same as the circumference of the circle. We can convert between radians, revolutions, and degrees using the relationship

1 revolution =   rad = 360°. See [Figure __REPLACE_Table_06_01__](#Table_06_01) for the conversion of degrees to radians for some common angles.

## Angular Velocity

How fast is an object rotating? We can answer this question by using the concept of angular velocity. Consider first the angular speed    is the rate at which the angle of rotation changes. In equation form, the angular speed is


which means that an angular rotation    occurs in a time,   . If an object rotates through a greater angle of rotation in a given time, it has a greater angular speed. The units for angular speed are radians per second (rad/s).

Now let’s consider the direction of the angular speed, which means we now must call it the angular velocity. The direction of the angular velocity is along the axis of rotation. For an object rotating clockwise, the angular velocity points away from you along the axis of rotation. For an object rotating counterclockwise, the angular velocity points toward you along the axis of rotation.

Angular velocity (ω) is the angular version of linear velocity **v**.  is the instantaneous linear velocity of an object in rotational motion**.**To get the precise relationship between angular velocity and tangential velocity, consider again a pit on the rotating CD. This pit moves through an arc length    in a *short* time    so its tangential *speed* is


From the definition of the angle of rotation,  , we see that   . Substituting this into the expression for *v*gives


The equation    says that the tangential speed *v* is proportional to the distance *r* from the center of rotation. Consequently, tangential speed is greater for a point on the outer edge of the CD (with larger *r*) than for a point closer to the center of the CD (with smaller *r*). This makes sense because a point farther out from the center has to cover a longer arc length in the same amount of time as a point closer to the center. Note that both points will still have the same angular speed, regardless of their distance from the center of rotation. See [Figure 3](#Figure_06_01_ArcLength).

![The picture shows a circle with a radius r2 going from the center, through a point 1 half-way on the radius and point 2 on the circumference. The distance from center to point 1 is labeled r1. A second radius line is drawn with an angle of change in theta. The arc from point 1 to the second radius is labeled change s1. The arc at point 2 is labeled change s2. There are two formulas to the right of the diagram: theta is equal to change of s1 over r1 and theta is equal to change of s2 over r2.__ALT__Figure_06_01_ArcLength](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_06_01_ArcLength.jpg)
***Figure 3** Points 1 and 2 rotate through the same angle (  ), but point 2 moves through a greater arc length (  ) because it is farther from the center of rotation.*


Now, consider another example: the tire of a moving car (see [Figure 4](#Figure_06_01_TireRotates)). The faster the tire spins, the faster the car moves—large    means large *v* because   . Similarly, a larger-radius tire rotating at the same angular velocity,  , will produce a greater linear (tangential) velocity, **v,** for the car. This is because a larger radius means a longer arc length must contact the road, so the car must move farther in the same amount of time.

![The diagram shows an illustration of the front part of a car. The diagram shows an arrow on the wheel pointing clockwise and labeled omega (angular velocity). There is a green arrow pointing toward the front of the car labeled v (velocity). The radius of the wheel is labeled r. To the right of the wheel is an equation v equals r times omega.__ALT__Figure_06_01_TireRotates](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_06_01_TireRotate.jpg)
***Figure 4** A car moving at a velocity, **v,** to the right has a tire rotating with angular velocity   . The speed of the tread of the tire relative to the axle is *v*, the same as if the car were jacked up and the wheels spinning without touching the road. Directly below the axle, where the tire touches the road, the tire tread moves backward with respect to the axle with tangential velocity  , where *r*is the tire radius. Because the road is stationary with respect to this point of the tire, the car must move forward at the linear velocity **v**. A larger angular velocity for the tire means a greater linear velocity for the car.*

However, there are cases where linear velocity and tangential velocity are not equivalent, such as a car spinning its tires on ice. In this case, the linear velocity will be less than the tangential velocity. Due to the lack of friction under the tires of a car on ice, the arc length through which the tire treads move is greater than the linear distance through which the car moves. It’s similar to running on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bike; you are literally going nowhere fast.

> Angular velocity **ω** and tangential velocity **v** are vectors, so we must include magnitude and direction. The direction of the angular velocity is along the axis of rotation, and points away from you for an object rotating clockwise, and toward you for an object rotating counterclockwise. In mathematics this is described by the right-hand rule. Tangential velocity is usually described as up, down, left, right, north, south, east, or west, as shown in [Figure 5](#Figure_06_01_Vinyl).

> ![The figure shows an illustration of a vinyl record with an arrow omega (angular velocity) pointing in a clockwise direction. There are two lines for the radius, marked r, one going from the center up and the other going from the center to the right. There are three flies on the record. One is positioned at the top of the record on the vertical radius. A v (velocity) arrow points to the right. A second fly is half-way around the circumference toward the horizontal radius and an arrow v is pointing tangential to the fly. The third fly is on the circumference at the horizontal radius and an arrow v is pointing down.__ALT__Figure_06_01_Vinyl](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_06_01_Vinyl.png)
> ***Figure 5** As the fly on the edge of an old-fashioned vinyl record moves in a circle, its instantaneous velocity is always at a tangent to the circle. The direction of the angular velocity is into the page this case.*
