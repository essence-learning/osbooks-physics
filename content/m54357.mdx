## Characteristics of Mirrors

There are three ways, as shown in [Figure 1](#Figure_16_01_Ray), in which light can travel from a source to another location. It can come directly from the source through empty space, such as from the Sun to Earth. Light can travel to an object through various media, such as air and glass. Light can also arrive at an object after being reflected, such as by a mirror. In all these cases, light is modeled as traveling in a straight line, called a . Light may change direction when it encounters the surface of a different material (such as a mirror) or when it passes from one material to another (such as when passing from air into glass). It then continues in a straight line—that is, as a ray. The word *ray* comes from mathematics. Here it means a straight line that originates from some point. It is acceptable to visualize light rays as laser rays (or even science fiction depictions of *ray guns*).

![In view (a), a cartoon image of Earth contains a house superimposed over North America. The Sun is included above and to the right of Earth. An arrow points from the Sun’s rays to a series of lines, which represent Earth’s atmosphere, directly above the Earth. In view (b), a woman is looking out of a window at her car. Arrows show the Sun’s rays bouncing off the car and traveling as light toward the woman.__ALT__Figure_16_01_Ray](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_16_01_Ray.jpg)
***Figure 1** Three methods for light to travel from a source to another location are shown. (a) Light reaches the upper atmosphere of Earth by traveling through empty space directly from the source (the Sun). (b) This light can reach a person in one of two ways. It can travel through a medium, such as air or glass, and typically travels from one medium to another. It can also reflect from an object, such as a mirror.*

Because light moves in straight lines, that is, as rays, and changes directions when it interacts with matter, it can be described through geometry and trigonometry. This part of optics, described by straight lines and angles, is therefore called . There are two laws that govern how light changes direction when it interacts with matter: the , for situations in which light bounces off matter; and the , for situations in which light passes through matter. In this section, we consider the geometric optics of .


Whenever we look into a mirror or squint at sunlight glinting from a lake, we are seeing a reflection. How does the reflected light travel from the object to your eyes? The law of reflection states: The ,  , equals the ,  
*.* This law governs the behavior of all waves when they interact with a smooth surface, and therefore describe the behavior of light waves as well. The reflection of light is simplified when light is treated as a ray. This concept is illustrated in [Figure 2](#Figure_16_01_Reflect), which also shows how the angles are measured relative to the line perpendicular to the surface at the point where the light ray strikes it. This perpendicular line is also called the *normal line*, or just the *normal*. Light reflected in this way is referred to as  (from the Latin word for *mirror*: *speculum*).

We expect to see reflections from smooth surfaces, but [Figure 3](#Figure_16_01_Reflect2), illustrates how a rough surface reflects light. Because the light is reflected from different parts of the surface at different angles, the rays go in many different directions, so the reflected light is . Diffused light allows you to read a printed page from almost any angle because some of the rays go in different directions. Many objects, such as people, clothing, leaves, and walls, have rough surfaces and can be seen from many angles. A mirror, on the other hand, has a smooth surface and reflects light at specific angles.

![A smooth, flat reflective surface is shown. A dotted line drops from the top of the figure and ends when it reaches the smooth surface. This line is perpendicular to the surface; there is a 90° angle between the surface and the perpendicular line. To the left of the perpendicular line, a ray (called an “incident ray” strikes the surface at a 45° angle. This ray—the “reflective ray”—is reflected off the surface to the right of the perpendicular line, again at a 45° angle. The angle between the incident ray and the perpendicular line is θi; the angle between the perpendicular line and the reflected ray is θr.__ALT__Figure_16_01_Reflect](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_16_01_Reflect.jpg)
***Figure 2** The law of reflection states that the angle of reflection, ***θ***, equals the angle of incidence, ***θ***. The angles are measured relative to the line perpendicular to the surface at the point where the ray strikes the surface. The incident and reflected rays, along with the normal, lie in the same plane.*

![A rough surface, such as the ground, is shown. Multiple rays are striking the uneven surface and are bouncing off the ground in different directions.__ALT__Figure_16_01_Reflect2](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_16_01_Reflect2.jpg)
***Figure 3** Light is diffused when it reflects from a rough surface. Here, many parallel rays are incident, but they are reflected at many different angles because the surface is rough.*

When we see ourselves in a mirror, it appears that our image is actually behind the mirror. We see the light coming from a direction determined by the law of reflection. The angles are such that our image is exactly the same distance behind the mirror, *d*, as the distance we stand away from the mirror, *d*. Although these mirror images make objects appear to be where they cannot be (such as behind a solid wall), the images are not figments of our imagination. Mirror images can be photographed and videotaped by instruments and look just as they do to our eyes, which are themselves optical instruments. An image in a mirror is said to be a , as opposed to a . A virtual image is formed when light rays appear to diverge from a point without actually doing so.

[Figure 4](#Figure_16_01_Flat_mirror) helps illustrate how a flat mirror forms an image. Two rays are shown emerging from the same point, striking the mirror, and reflecting into the observer’s eye. The rays can diverge slightly, and both still enter the eye. If the rays are extrapolated backward, they seem to originate from a common point behind the mirror, allowing us to locate the image. The paths of the reflected rays into the eye are the same as if they had come directly from that point behind the mirror. Using the law of reflection—the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence—we can see that the image and object are the same distance from the mirror. This is a virtual image, as defined earlier.

![A flat mirror is placed perpendicular to our field of view. We see the side of the mirror. A bottle is placed to the left of the mirror at distance do to the mirror. Two rays originate from the bottle, strike the mirror, and reflect to an eye that is looking at the mirror. To the right of the mirror, a virtual image of the bottle is included as a backward extrapolation of the path of the rays from the eye to the mirror. The bottle to the right of the mirror is at distance di from the mirror.__ALT__Figure_16_01_Flat_mirror](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_16_01_FlatMirror.jpg)
***Figure 4** When two sets of rays from common points on an object are reflected by a flat mirror into the eye of an observer, the reflected rays seem to originate from behind the mirror, which determines the position of the virtual image.*

> ### Mirror Mazes
> [Figure 5](#Figure_16_01_Maze) is a chase scene from an old silent film called *The Circus*, starring Charlie Chaplin. The chase scene takes place in a mirror maze. You may have seen such a maze at an amusement park or carnival. Finding your way through the maze can be very difficult. Keep in mind that only one image in the picture is real—the others are virtual.

Some mirrors are curved instead of flat. A mirror that curves inward is called a , whereas one that curves outward is called a . Pick up a well-polished metal spoon and you can see an example of each type of curvature. The side of the spoon that holds the food is a concave mirror; the back of the spoon is a convex mirror. Observe your image on both sides of the spoon.

> You can remember the difference between concave and convex by thinking, *Concave means caved in*.
Ray diagrams can be used to find the point where reflected rays converge or appear to converge, or the point from which rays appear to diverge. This is called the , F. The distance from F to the mirror along the  (the line perpendicular to the center of the mirror’s surface) is called the , *f*. [Figure 7](#Figure_16_01_Curved_mirror) shows the focal points of concave and convex mirrors.

![There are two curved mirrors in this figure. In view (a), the front of a concave mirror is struck by rays of light that originate in front of the mirror. The rays reflect off the concave mirror and converge at varying angles to a point F in front of the mirror. The distance from F to the mirror is f. In view (b), the back of a convex mirror is struck by rays of light that diverge off the back of the mirror at varying angles. If one were to extrapolate the diverging rays backward, to the front of the mirror, the backward-extrapolated rays meet at point F; however, the distance from the back of the mirror to F is a negative f.__ALT__Figure_16_01_Curved_mirror](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_16_01_Curved.jpg)
***Figure 7** (a, b) The focal length for the concave mirror in (a), formed by converging rays, is in front of the mirror, and has a positive value. The focal length for the convex mirror in (b), formed by diverging rays, appears to be behind the mirror, and has a negative value.*

Images formed by a concave mirror vary, depending on which side of the focal point the object is placed. For any object placed on the far side of the focal point with respect to the mirror, the rays converge in front of the mirror to form a real image, which can be projected onto a surface, such as a screen or sheet of paper However, for an object located inside the focal point with respect to the concave mirror, the image is virtual. For a convex mirror the image is always virtual—that is, it appears to be behind the mirror. The ray diagrams in [Figure 8](#Figure_16_01_Curved2) show how to determine the nature of the image formed by concave and convex mirrors.

![View (a) shows a concave mirror to the right with a lit candle to the left placed outside the focal point. It is a real image. View (b) shows a concave mirror to the right with a lit candle to the left placed inside the focal point. This image is virtual. View (c) shows a convex mirror to the right with a lit candle to the left. The image is virtual.__ALT__Figure_16_01_Curved2](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_16_01_Curved2.jpg)
***Figure 8** (a) The image of an object placed outside the focal point of a concave mirror is inverted and real. (b) The image of an object placed inside the focal point of a concave mirror is erect and virtual. (c) The image of an object formed by a convex mirror is erect and virtual.*

The information in [Figure 8](#Figure_16_01_Curved2) is summarized in [Figure __REPLACE_Table_16_01__](#Table_16_01).

You should be able to notice everyday applications of curved mirrors. One common example is the use of security mirrors in stores, as shown in [Figure 9](#Figure_16_01_Convex_Example).

![The image shows a woman taking a picture in front of a convex mirror.__ALT__Figure_16_01_Convex_Example](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_16_01_Convex.jpg)
***Figure 9** Security mirrors are convex, producing a smaller, upright image. Because the image is smaller, a larger area is imaged compared with what would be observed for a flat mirror; hence, security is improved. (credit: Laura D’Alessandro, Flickr)*

Some telescopes also use curved mirrors and no lenses (except in the eyepieces) both to magnify images and to change the path of light. [Figure 10](#Figure_16_01_Schmidt) shows a Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. This design uses a spherical primary concave mirror and a convex secondary mirror. The image is projected onto the focal plane by light passing through the perforated primary mirror. The effective focal length of such a telescope is the focal length of the primary mirror multiplied by the magnification of the secondary mirror. The result is a telescope with a focal length much greater than the length of the telescope itself.

![There is an eye to the right of the diagram. The eye represents the focal plane. Moving from right to left, in front of the eye, there is a perforated primary mirror and a secondary mirror. The end of the telescope is to the left of the figure. Rays enter the end of the telescoped, hit the primary mirror, bounce backward to the secondary mirror, bounce through the hole (perforation) in the primary mirror, and travel to the eye.__ALT__Figure_16_01_Schmidt](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_16_01_Schmidt.jpg)
***Figure 10** This diagram shows the design of a Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope.*

A parabolic concave mirror has the very useful property that all light from a distant source, on reflection by the mirror surface, is directed to the focal point. Likewise, a light source placed at the focal point directs all the light it emits in parallel lines away from the mirror. This case is illustrated by the ray diagram in [Figure 11](#Figure_16_01_Concave). The light source in a car headlight, for example, is located at the focal point of a parabolic mirror.

![This diagram shows a car headlight, also called a spotlight, which has a light bulb surrounded by a parabolic mirror. The mirror is bowl shaped, with the bulb sitting at the center of recessed side of the bowl. Arrows show that light rays from the bulb extend out in all directions and then bounce off of the mirror so that all of the light rays travel straight out from the headlight__ALT__Figure_16_01_Concave](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_16_01_Concave.jpg)
***Figure 11** The bulb in this ray diagram of a car headlight is located at the focal point of a parabolic mirror.*

Parabolic mirrors are also used to collect sunlight and direct it to a focal point, where it is transformed into heat, which in turn can be used to generate electricity. This application is shown in [Figure 12](#Figure_16_01_Concave2).

## The Application of the Curved Mirror Equations

Curved mirrors and the images they create involve a fairly small number of variables: the mirror’s radius of curvature, *R*; the focal length, *f*; the distances of the object and image from the mirror, *d* and *d*, respectively; and the heights of the object and image, *h* and *h*, respectively. The signs of these values indicate whether the image is inverted, erect (upright), real, or virtual. We now look at the equations that relate these variables and apply them to everyday problems.

[Figure 13](#Figure_16_01_Ray2) shows the meanings of most of the variables we will use for calculations involving curved mirrors.

![This figure shows an old-fashioned key inside the focal point of a concave mirror. All the variables used for calculations involving curved mirrors depicted.__ALT__Figure_16_01_Ray2](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_16_01_Ray2.jpg)
***Figure 13** Look for the variables, *d, d, h, h,* and *f* in this figure.*

The basic equation that describes both lenses and mirrors is the lens/mirror equation


This equation can be rearranged several ways. For example, it may be written to solve for focal length.


Magnification, *m*, is the ratio of the size of the image, *h*, to the size of the object, *h*. The value of *m* can be calculated in two ways.


This relationship can be written to solve for any of the variables involved. For example, the height of the image is given by


We saved the simplest equation for last. The radius of curvature of a curved mirror, *R*, is simply twice the focal length.


We can learn important information from the algebraic sign of the result of a calculation using the previous equations:

* A negative *d* indicates a virtual image; a positive value indicates a real image
* A negative *h* indicates an inverted image; a positive value indicates an erect image
* For concave mirrors, *f* is positive; for convex mirrors, *f* is negative
Now let’s apply these equations to solve some problems.
