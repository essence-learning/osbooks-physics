## How the Kinematic Equations are Related to Acceleration
We are studying concepts related to motion: time, displacement, , and especially acceleration. We are only concerned with motion in one dimension. The  that we will be using apply to conditions of constant acceleration, except where noted, and show how these concepts are related.  is acceleration that does not change over time. The first kinematic equation relates displacement *d*, average velocity  , and time *t*.

The initial displacement  

 is often 0, in which case the equation can be written as

This equation, which is the definition of average velocity and valid for both constant and non-constant acceleration, says that average velocity is  per unit time. We will express velocity in meters per second. If we graph displacement versus time, as in [Figure 1](#Figure_03_02_displace), the slope will be the velocity. Whenever a rate, such as velocity, is represented graphically, time is usually taken to be the independent variable and is plotted along the *x* axis.

![ A line graph is shown. The x-axis is labeled time and includes a directional arrow pointing to the right. The y-axis is labeled displacement and includes a directional arrow pointing upward. The graphed line shows a directly proportional relationship between time and displacement.__ALT__Figure_03_02_displace](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_03_02_displace.jpg)
***Figure 1** The slope of displacement versus time is velocity.*

The second kinematic equation, another expression for average velocity  
 is simply the initial velocity plus the final velocity divided by two. This equation is only valid for constant acceleration.


Now we come to our main focus of this chapter; namely, the kinematic equations that describe motion with constant acceleration. In the third kinematic equation, acceleration is the rate at which velocity increases, so velocity at any point equals initial velocity plus acceleration multiplied by time


Note that this third kinematic equation does not have displacement in it. Therefore, if you do not know the displacement and are not trying to solve for a displacement, this equation might be a good one to use.

The third kinematic equation is also represented by the graph in [Figure 2](#Figure_03_02_time).

![A line graph is shown. The x-axis is labeled time in seconds and the y-axis is labeled velocity in meters per second. The graphed line shows a directly proportional relationship between time and velocity.__ALT__Figure_03_02_time](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_03_02_time.jpg)
***Figure 2** The slope of velocity versus time is acceleration.*

The fourth kinematic equation shows how displacement is related to acceleration


When starting at the origin,    and, when starting from rest,  , in which case the equation can be written as


This equation tells us that, for constant acceleration, the slope of a plot of 2*d* versus *t*<sup>2</sup> is acceleration, as shown in [Figure 3](#Figure_03_02_line).

![A line graph is shown. The x-axis is labeled t squared and the y-axis is labeled two d in meters. The graphed line shows that the slope of two d versus t squared equals constant acceleration.__ALT__Figure_03_02_line](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_03_02_line.jpg)
***Figure 3** When acceleration is constant, the slope of 2*d* versus *t*<sup>2</sup> gives the acceleration.*

The fifth kinematic equation relates velocity, acceleration, and displacement


This equation is useful for when we do not know, or do not need to know, the time.

When starting from rest, the fifth equation simplifies to


According to this equation, a graph of velocity squared versus twice the displacement will have a slope equal to acceleration.

![A line graph is shown. The x-axis is labeled two d in meters and the y-axis is labeled v squared in meters per second squared. The graphed line shows a directly proportional relationship between two d, twice the displacement, and v squared, velocity squared.__ALT__Figure_03_02_slope](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_03_02_slope.jpg)
***Figure 4** *

Note that, in reality, knowns and unknowns will vary. Sometimes you will want to rearrange a kinematic equation so that the knowns are the values on the axes and the unknown is the slope. Sometimes the intercept will not be at the origin (0,0). This will happen when *v* or *d* is not zero. This will be the case when the object of interest is already in motion, or the motion begins at some point other than at the origin of the coordinate system.

> Look at the Moving Man simulation again and this time use the *Charts* view. Again, vary the velocity and acceleration by sliding the red and green markers along the scales. Keeping the velocity marker near zero will make the effect of acceleration more obvious. Observe how the graphs of position, velocity, and acceleration vary with time. Note which are linear plots and which are not.

## Applying Kinematic Equations to Situations of Constant Acceleration
Problem-solving skills are essential to success in a science and life in general. The ability to apply broad physical principles, which are often represented by equations, to specific situations is a very powerful form of knowledge. It is much more powerful than memorizing a list of facts. Analytical skills and problem-solving abilities can be applied to new situations, whereas a list of facts cannot be made long enough to contain every possible circumstance. Essential analytical skills will be developed by solving problems in this text and will be useful for understanding physics and science in general throughout your life.

### Problem-Solving Steps
While no single step-by-step method works for every problem, the following general procedures facilitate problem solving and make the answers more meaningful. A certain amount of creativity and insight are required as well.

* *Examine the situation to determine which physical principles are involved. It is vital to draw a simple sketch at the outset.* Decide which direction is positive and note that on your sketch.
* *Identify the knowns: Make a list of what information is given or can be inferred from the problem statement.* Remember, not all given information will be in the form of a number with units in the problem. If something starts *from rest*, we know the initial velocity is zero. If something *stops*, we know the final velocity is zero.
* *Identify the unknowns: Decide exactly what needs to be determined in the problem.*
* *Find an equation or set of equations that can help you solve the problem.* Your list of knowns and unknowns can help here. For example, if time is not needed or not given, then the fifth kinematic equation, which does not include time, could be useful.
* *Insert the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical solutions complete with units.* This step produces the numerical answer; it also provides a check on units that can help you find errors. If the units of the answer are incorrect, then an error has been made.
* *Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense?* This final step is extremely important because the goal of physics is to accurately describe nature. To see if the answer is reasonable, check its magnitude, its sign, and its units. Are the significant figures correct?
### Summary of Problem Solving
* Determine the knowns and unknowns.
* Find an equation that expresses the unknown in terms of the knowns. More than one unknown means more than one equation is needed.
* Solve the equation or equations.
* Be sure units and significant figures are correct.
* Check whether the answer is reasonable.

> 
> The object of the sport of drag racing is acceleration. Period! The races take place from a standing start on a straight one-quarter-mile (402 m) track. Usually two cars race side by side, and the winner is the driver who gets the car past the quarter-mile point first. At the finish line, the cars may be going more than 300 miles per hour (134 m/s). The driver then deploys a parachute to bring the car to a stop because it is unsafe to brake at such high speeds. The cars, called dragsters, are capable of accelerating at 26 m/s<sup>2</sup>. By comparison, a typical sports car that is available to the general public can accelerate at about 5 m/s<sup>2</sup>.

## Practice Problems


## Constant Acceleration
In many cases,  is not uniform because the force acting on the accelerating object is not constant over time. A situation that gives constant acceleration is the acceleration of falling objects. When air resistance is not a factor, all objects near Earth’s surface fall with an acceleration of about 9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup>. Although this value decreases slightly with increasing altitude, it may be assumed to be essentially constant. The value of 9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup> is labeled *g* and is referred to as .  is the force that causes nonsupported objects to accelerate downward—or, more precisely, toward the center of Earth. The magnitude of this force is called the weight of the object and is given by *mg* where *m* is the mass of the object (in kg). In places other than on Earth, such as the Moon or on other planets, *g* is not 9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup>, but takes on other values. When using *g* for the acceleration *a* in a kinematic equation, it is usually given a negative sign because the acceleration due to gravity is downward.

> ### Effects of Rapid Acceleration

> ***Figure 6** Astronauts train using G Force Simulators. (NASA)*
> 
> When in a vehicle that accelerates rapidly, you experience a force on your entire body that accelerates your body. You feel this force in automobiles and slightly more on amusement park rides. For example, when you ride in a car that turns, the car applies a force on your body to make you accelerate in the direction in which the car is turning. If enough force is applied, you will accelerate at 9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup>. This is the same as the acceleration due to gravity, so this force is called one G.
> 
> One G is the force required to accelerate an object at the acceleration due to gravity at Earth’s surface. Thus, one G for a paper cup is much less than one G for an elephant, because the elephant is much more massive and requires a greater force to make it accelerate at 9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup>. For a person, a G of about 4 is so strong that his or her face will distort as the bones accelerate forward through the loose flesh. Other symptoms at extremely high Gs include changes in vision, loss of consciousness, and even death. The space shuttle produces about 3 Gs during takeoff and reentry. Some roller coasters and dragsters produce forces of around 4 Gs for their occupants. A fighter jet can produce up to 12 Gs during a sharp turn.

> 
> People, such as astronauts, who work with G forces must also be trained to experience zero G—also called free fall or weightlessness—which can cause queasiness. NASA has an aircraft that allows it occupants to experience about 25 s of free fall. The aircraft is nicknamed the *Vomit Comet*.
