## Mechanical Energy and Conservation of Energy
We saw earlier that mechanical energy can be either potential or kinetic. In this section we will see how energy is transformed from one of these forms to the other. We will also see that, in a closed system, the sum of these forms of energy remains constant.

Quite a bit of potential energy is gained by a roller coaster car and its passengers when they are raised to the top of the first hill. Remember that the *potential* part of the term means that energy has been stored and can be used at another time. You will see that this stored energy can either be used to do work or can be transformed into kinetic energy. For example, when an object that has gravitational potential energy falls, its energy is converted to kinetic energy. Remember that both work and energy are expressed in joules.

Refer back to [Figure __REPLACE_Figure_09_01_Lifting__](#Figure_09_01_Lifting). The amount of work required to raise the TV from point A to point B is equal to the amount of gravitational potential energy the TV gains from its height above the ground. This is generally true for any object raised above the ground. If all the work done on an object is used to raise the object above the ground, the amount work equals the object’s gain in gravitational potential energy. However, note that because of the work done by friction, these energy–work transformations are never perfect. Friction causes the loss of some useful energy. In the discussions to follow, we will use the approximation that transformations are frictionless.

Now, let’s look at the roller coaster in [Figure 1](#Figure_09_02_roller). Work was done on the roller coaster to get it to the top of the first rise; at this point, the roller coaster has gravitational potential energy. It is moving slowly, so it also has a small amount of kinetic energy. As the car descends the first slope, its *PE* is converted to *KE*. At the low point much of the original *PE* has been transformed to *KE*, and speed is at a maximum. As the car moves up the next slope, some of the *KE* is transformed back into *PE* and the car slows down.

![An illustration shows a side view of a roller coaster. People in a cart are at the top of a hill, and the cart is labeled Start. The cart is heading towards a downward slope. The opposite end of the roller coaster is flat and is labeled Finish.__ALT__Figure_09_02_roller](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_09_02_coaster.jpg)
***Figure 1** During this roller coaster ride, there are conversions between potential and kinetic energy.*


> ### Energy Skate Park Basics
> This simulation shows how kinetic and potential energy are related, in a scenario similar to the roller coaster. Observe the changes in *KE* and *PE* by clicking on the bar graph boxes. Also try the three differently shaped skate parks. Drag the skater to the track to start the animation.

On an actual roller coaster, there are many ups and downs, and each of these is accompanied by transitions between kinetic and potential energy. Assume that no energy is lost to friction. At any point in the ride, the total mechanical energy is the same, and it is equal to the energy the car had at the top of the first rise. This is a result of the , which says that, in a closed system, total energy is conservedthat is, it is constant. Using subscripts 1 and 2 to represent initial and final energy, this law is expressed as

<equation id="fs-id1167066020906" class="unnumbered"><label /> <math> <mrow>  <mi>K</mi><msub>   <mi>E</mi>   <mn>1</mn>  </msub>  <mo>+</mo><mi>P</mi><msub>   <mi>E</mi>   <mn>1</mn>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo><mi>K</mi><msub>   <mi>E</mi>   <mn>2</mn>  </msub>  <mo>+</mo><mi>P</mi><msub>   <mi>E</mi>   <mn>2</mn>  </msub><mtext>.</mtext>  </mrow></math></equation>
Either side equals the total mechanical energy. The phrase *in a* means we are assuming no energy is lost to the surroundings due to friction and air resistance. If we are making calculations on dense falling objects, this is a good assumption. For the roller coaster, this assumption introduces some inaccuracy to the calculation.

## Calculations involving Mechanical Energy and Conservation of Energy
> When calculating work or energy, use units of meters for distance, newtons for force, kilograms for mass, and seconds for time. This will assure that the result is expressed in joules.

> ### Conservation of Energy
> This video discusses conversion of *PE* to *KE* and conservation of energy. The scenario is very similar to the roller coaster and the skate park. It is also a good explanation of the energy changes studied in the snap lab.

> In this activity, you will calculate the potential energy of an object and predict the object’s speed when all that potential energy has been converted to kinetic energy. You will then check your prediction.
