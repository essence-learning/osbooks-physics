## Phase Changes
So far, we have learned that adding thermal energy by heat increases the temperature of a substance. But surprisingly, there are situations where adding energy does not change the temperature of a substance at all! Instead, the additional thermal energy acts to loosen bonds between molecules or atoms and causes a . Because this energy enters or leaves a system during a phase change without causing a temperature change in the system, it is known as  (latent means *hidden*).

The three phases of matter that you frequently encounter are solid, liquid and gas (see [Figure 1](#Figure_11_03_Phases)). Solid has the least energetic state; atoms in solids are in close contact, with forces between them that allow the particles to vibrate but not change position with neighboring particles. (These forces can be thought of as springs that can be stretched or compressed, but not easily broken.)

Liquid has a more energetic state, in which particles can slide smoothly past one another and change neighbors, although they are still held together by their mutual attraction.

Gas has a more energetic state than liquid, in which particles are broken free of their bonds. Particles in gases are separated by distances that are large compared with the size of the particles.

The most energetic state of all is . Although you may not have heard much about plasma, it is actually the most common state of matter in the universe—stars are made up of plasma, as is lightning. The plasma state is reached by heating a gas to the point where particles are pulled apart, separating the electrons from the rest of the particle. This produces an ionized gas that is a combination of the negatively charged free electrons and positively charged ions, known as plasma.

![A rock, representing a solid is shown in part (a), along with its tightly bound particles. In part (b), liquid water is shown with its molecules attracted to one another, but not tightly bound. In part (c) oxygen is shown with molecules far apart and bouncing off one another in random directions.__ALT__Figure_11_03_Phases](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_11_03_Phases.jpg)
***Figure 1** (a) Particles in a solid always have the same neighbors, held close by forces represented here by springs. These particles are essentially in contact with one another. A rock is an example of a solid. This rock retains its shape because of the forces holding its atoms or molecules together. (b) Particles in a liquid are also in close contact but can slide over one another. Forces between them strongly resist attempts to push them closer together and also hold them in close contact. Water is an example of a liquid. Water can flow, but it also remains in an open container because of the forces between its molecules. (c) Particles in a gas are separated by distances that are considerably larger than the size of the particles themselves, and they move about freely. A gas must be held in a closed container to prevent it from moving out into its surroundings. (d) The atmosphere is ionized in the extreme heat of a lightning strike.*

During a phase change, matter changes from one phase to another, either through the addition of energy by heat and the transition to a more energetic state, or from the removal of energy by heat and the transition to a less energetic state.

Phase changes to a more energetic state include the following:

* —Solid to liquid
* —Liquid to gas (included boiling and evaporation)
* —Solid to gas
* Gas to plasma
Phase changes to a less energetic state are as follows:

* —Gas to liquid
* —Liquid to solid
* —Plasma to gas
* Gas to solid
Energy is required to melt a solid because the bonds between the particles in the solid must be broken. Since the energy involved in a phase changes is used to break bonds, there is no increase in the kinetic energies of the particles, and therefore no rise in temperature. Similarly, energy is needed to vaporize a liquid to overcome the attractive forces between particles in the liquid. There is no temperature change until a phase change is completed. The temperature of a cup of soda and ice that is initially at 0   stays at 0   until all of the ice has melted. In the reverse of these processes—freezing and condensation—energy is released from the latent heat (see [Figure 2](#Figure_11_03_PhaseChng)).


![Energy input (melting) converts solid to liquid. Energy output (freezing) converts liquid to solid. Energy input (boiling) converts liquid to gas. Energy output (condensation) converts gas to liquid. Energy input (sublimation) converts solid to gas.__ALT__Figure_11_03_PhaseChng](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_11_03_PhaseChng.jpg)
***Figure 2** (a) Energy is required to partially overcome the attractive forces between particles in a solid to form a liquid. That same energy must be removed for freezing to take place. (b) Particles are separated by large distances when changing from liquid to vapor, requiring significant energy to overcome molecular attraction. The same energy must be removed for condensation to take place. There is no temperature change until a phase change is completed. (c) Enough energy is added that the liquid state is skipped over completely as a substance undergoes sublimation.*

Let’s consider the example of adding heat to ice to examine its transitions through all three phases—solid to liquid to gas. A  indicating the temperature changes of water as energy is added is shown in [Figure 3](#Figure_11_03_WaterPhases). The ice starts out at −20 , and its temperature rises linearly, absorbing heat at a constant rate until it reaches 0   Once at this temperature, the ice gradually melts, absorbing 334 kJ/kg. The temperature remains constant at 0   during this phase change. Once all the ice has melted, the temperature of the liquid water rises, absorbing heat at a new constant rate. At 100 , the water begins to boil and the temperature again remains constant while the water absorbs 2256 kJ/kg during this phase change. When all the liquid has become steam, the temperature rises again at a constant rate.

![A graph of change in heat per mass on the x-axis and change in temperature on the y-axis is shown. It is level during phase changes, indicating no change in temperature, and rises steeply after phase changes are completed.__ALT__Figure_11_03_WaterPhases](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_11_03_WaterPhase.jpg)
***Figure 3** A graph of temperature versus added energy. The system is constructed so that no vapor forms while ice warms to become liquid water, and so when vaporization occurs, the vapor remains in the system. The long stretches of constant temperature values at 0   and 100   reflect the large latent heats of melting and vaporization, respectively.*

We have seen that vaporization requires heat transfer to a substance from its surroundings. Condensation is the reverse process, where heat in transferred *away from* a substance *to* its surroundings. This release of latent heat increases the temperature of the surroundings. Energy must be removed from the condensing particles to make a vapor condense. This is why condensation occurs on cold surfaces: the heat transfers energy away from the warm vapor to the cold surface. The energy is exactly the same as that required to cause the phase change in the other direction, from liquid to vapor, and so it can be calculated from   . Latent heat is also released into the environment when a liquid freezes, and can be calculated from   .

> Ice cream is certainly easy enough to buy at the supermarket, but for the hardcore ice cream enthusiast, that may not be satisfying enough. Going through the process of making your own ice cream lets you invent your own flavors and marvel at the physics firsthand ([Figure 4](#Figure_11_03_IceCream)).
> 
> The first step to making homemade ice cream is to mix heavy cream, whole milk, sugar, and your flavor of choice; it could be as simple as cocoa powder or vanilla extract, or as fancy as pomegranates or pistachios.
> 
> The next step is to pour the mixture into a container that is deep enough that you will be able to churn the mixture without it spilling over, and that is also freezer-safe. After placing it in the freezer, the ice cream has to be stirred vigorously every 45 minutes for four to five hours. This slows the freezing process and prevents the ice cream from turning into a solid block of ice. Most people prefer a soft creamy texture instead of one giant popsicle.
> 
> As it freezes, the cream undergoes a phase change from liquid to solid. By now, we’re experienced enough to know that this means that the cream must experience a loss of heat. Where does that heat go? Due to the temperature difference between the freezer and the ice cream mixture, heat transfers thermal energy from the ice cream to the air in the freezer. Once the temperature in the freezer rises enough, the freezer is cooled by pumping excess heat outside into the kitchen.
> 
> A faster way to make ice cream is to chill it by placing the mixture in a plastic bag, surrounded by another plastic bag half full of ice. (You can also add a teaspoon of salt to the outer bag to lower the temperature of the ice/salt mixture.) Shaking the bag for five minutes churns the ice cream while cooling it evenly. In this case, the heat transfers energy out of the ice cream mixture and into the ice during the phase change.

## Section Summary
* Most substances have four distinct phases: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.
* Gas is the most energetic state and solid is the least.
* During a phase change, a substance undergoes transition to a higher energy state when heat is added, or to a lower energy state when heat is removed.
* Heat is added to a substance during melting and vaporization.
* Latent heat is released by a substance during condensation and freezing.
* Phase changes occur at fixed temperatures called boiling and freezing (or melting) points for a given substance.
