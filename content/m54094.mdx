## Graphing Velocity as a Function of Time
Earlier, we examined s of  versus . Now, we are going to build on that information as we look at graphs of  vs. time. Velocity is the rate of change of .  is the rate of change of velocity; we will discuss acceleration more in another chapter. These concepts are all very interrelated.

> ### Maze Game
> In this simulation you will use a vector diagram to manipulate a ball into a certain location without hitting a wall. You can manipulate the ball directly with position or by changing its velocity. Explore how these factors change the motion. If you would like, you can put it on the *a* setting, as well. This is acceleration, which measures the rate of change of velocity. We will explore acceleration in more detail later, but it might be interesting to take a look at it here.

What can we learn about motion by looking at velocity vs. time graphs? Let’s return to our drive to school, and look at a graph of position versus time as shown in [Figure 1](#Figure_02_04_drive).

![A line graph titled Position versus Time is shown. The x-axis is labeled time in minutes and has a scale from zero to twenty in increments of one. The y-axis is labeled position, d, in kilometers and has a scale from zero to twelve in increments of one. The line intersects the following data points to form a line that slopes upward and then downward: zero, zero; two, one; four, two; ten, five; twelve, four; fourteen, three; twenty, zero.__ALT__Figure_02_04_drive](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_02_04_drive.jpg)
***Figure 1** A graph of position versus time for the drive to and from school is shown.*

We assumed for our original calculation that your parent drove with a constant velocity to and from school. We now know that the car could not have gone from rest to a constant velocity without speeding up. So the actual graph would be curved on either end, but let’s make the same approximation as we did then, anyway.

> It is common in physics, especially at the early learning stages, for certain things to be *neglected*, as we see here. This is because it makes the concept clearer or the calculation easier. Practicing physicists use these kinds of short-cuts, as well. It works out because usually the thing being *neglected* is small enough that it does not significantly affect the answer. In the earlier example, the amount of time it takes the car to speed up and reach its cruising velocity is very small compared to the total time traveled.
Looking at this graph, and given what we learned, we can see that there are two distinct periods to the car’s motion—the way to school and the way back. The average velocity for the drive to school is 0.5 km/minute. We can see that the average velocity for the drive back is –0.5 km/minute. If we plot the data showing velocity versus time, we get another graph ([Figure 2](#Figure_02_04_velocity)):

![A graph that shows time in minutes on the x-axis and velocity in kilometers per minute on the y axis. A horizontal line is show at a velocity of 0.5 that runs from 0 to 10 minutes. Another horizontal line is shown at a velocity of –0.5 that runs from 10 to 20 minutes.__ALT__Figure_02_04_velocity](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_02_04_velocity.jpg)
***Figure 2** Graph of velocity versus time for the drive to and from school.*

We can learn a few things. First, we can derive a **v** versus *t* graph from a **d** versus *t* graph. Second, if we have a straight-line position–time graph that is positively or negatively sloped, it will yield a horizontal velocity graph. There are a few other interesting things to note. Just as we could use a position vs. time graph to determine velocity, we can use a velocity vs. time graph to determine position. We know that **v** = **d**/*t*. If we use a little algebra to re-arrange the equation, we see that **d** = **v**    *t*. In [Figure 2](#Figure_02_04_velocity), we have velocity on the *y*-axis and time along the *x*-axis. Let’s take just the first half of the motion. We get 0.5 km/minute    10 minutes. The units for *minutes* cancel each other, and we get 5 km, which is the displacement for the trip to school. If we calculate the same for the return trip, we get –5 km. If we add them together, we see that the net displacement for the whole trip is 0 km, which it should be because we started and ended at the same place.

> You can treat units just like you treat numbers, so a km/km=1 (or, we say, it cancels out). This is good because it can tell us whether or not we have calculated everything with the correct units. For instance, if we end up with m × s for velocity instead of m/s, we know that something has gone wrong, and we need to check our math. This process is called dimensional analysis, and it is one of the best ways to check if your math makes sense in physics.
The area under a velocity curve represents the displacement. The velocity curve also tells us whether the car is speeding up. In our earlier example, we stated that the velocity was constant. So, the car is not speeding up. Graphically, you can see that the slope of these two lines is 0. This slope tells us that the car is not speeding up, or accelerating. We will do more with this information in a later chapter. For now, just remember that the area under the graph and the slope are the two important parts of the graph. Just like we could define a linear equation for the motion in a position vs. time graph, we can also define one for a velocity vs. time graph. As we said, the slope equals the acceleration, **a**. And in this graph, the *y*-intercept is **v**. Thus,   .

But what if the velocity is not constant? Let’s look back at our jet-car example. At the beginning of the motion, as the car is speeding up, we saw that its position is a curve, as shown in [Figure 3](#Figure_02_04_car).

![A line graph titled Jet Car Displacement is shown. The x-axis is labeled time, t, in seconds and has a scale from zero to forty on increments of ten. The y-axis is labeled displacement, x, in meters and has a scale from zero to three thousand five hundred in increments of five hundred. The following approximate data points are plotted, resulting in a line that curves upward: eight, two hundred fifty; ten, five hundred; fifteen, one thousand; twenty, one thousand five hundred; twenty-five, two thousand; thirty, three thousand. A right triangle is drawn at points eight, two hundred fifty; twelve, two hundred fifty, and twelve seven hundred fifty. The legs are labeled change in tp and change in dp. Point ten, five hundred is labeled P. Another right triangle is drawn at points twenty, one thousand five hundred; thirty, one thousand five hundred, and thirty, three thousand. The legs are labeled change in tq and change in dq. Point twenty-five, two thousand is labeled Q.__ALT__Figure_02_04_car](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_02_04_car.jpg)
***Figure 3** A graph is shown of the position of a jet-powered car during the time span when it is speeding up. The slope of a d vs. t graph is velocity. This is shown at two points. Instantaneous velocity at any point is the slope of the tangent at that point.*

You do not have to do this, but you could, theoretically, take the instantaneous velocity at each point on this graph. If you did, you would get [Figure 4](#Figure_02_04_power), which is just a straight line with a positive slope.

![A line graph titled Jet Car Velocity is shown. The x-axis is labeled time, t, in seconds and has a scale from zero to forty on increments of ten. The y-axis is labeled velocity, v, in meters per second and has a scale from zero to one hundred eighty in increments of twenty. A straight line with a positive slope is plotted that intersects the following approximate points: zero, eighteen; ten, sixty (labeled P); fifteen, ninety; twenty, one hundred twenty; twenty five, one hundred fifty (labeled Q); thirty, one hundred sixty. Slope equals a is shown above the graphed lined.__ALT__Figure_02_04_power](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_02_04_power.jpg)
***Figure 4** The graph shows the velocity of a jet-powered car during the time span when it is speeding up.*

Again, if we take the slope of the velocity vs. time graph, we get the acceleration, the rate of change of the velocity. And, if we take the area under the slope, we get back to the displacement.


## Solving Problems using Velocity–Time Graphs
Most velocity vs. time graphs will be straight lines. When this is the case, our calculations are fairly simple.

> ### Using Velocity Graph to Calculate Some Stuff: Jet Car

> You can have negative position, velocity, and acceleration on a graph that describes the way the object is moving. You should never see a graph with negative time on an axis. Why?
Most of the velocity vs. time graphs we will look at will be simple to interpret. Occasionally, we will look at curved graphs of velocity vs. time. More often, these curved graphs occur when something is speeding up, often from rest. Let’s look back at a more realistic velocity vs. time graph of the jet car’s motion that takes this *speeding up* stage into account.

![A line graph titled Jet Car Velocity is shown. The x-axis is labeled time, t, in seconds and has a scale from zero to eighty on increments of ten. The y-axis is labeled velocity, v, in meters per second and has a scale from one hundred sixty to two hundred sixty in increments of ten. The following approximate data points are plotted and connected to form a line that curves upward, and then becomes flat: zero, one hundred sixty five; ten, two hundred ten; twenty, two hundred thirty; thirty, two hundred forty; forty, two hundred forty-five; fifty, two hundred forty-five; sixty, two hundred forty-five; seventy, two hundred forty-five. A right triangle is drawn, with a hypotenuse that intersects points twenty, two hundred thirty and thirty, two hundred forty. The bottom leg of the triangle has ends at points zero, two hundred ten and fifty, two hundred ten and is labeled change in t. The upright leg has ends at points fifty, two hundred ten and fifty, two hundred sixty and is labeled change in v.__ALT__Figure_02_04_accurate](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_02_04_accurate.jpg)
***Figure 5** The graph shows a more accurate graph of the velocity of a jet-powered car during the time span when it is speeding up.*
