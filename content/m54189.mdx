## Concepts Related to Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation
Sir Isaac Newton was the first scientist to precisely define the gravitational force, and to show that it could explain both falling bodies and astronomical motions. See [Figure 1](#Figure_07_02_apple). But Newton was not the first to suspect that the same force caused both our weight and the motion of planets. His forerunner, Galileo Galilei, had contended that falling bodies and planetary motions had the same cause. Some of Newton’s contemporaries, such as Robert Hooke, Christopher Wren, and Edmund Halley, had also made some progress toward understanding gravitation. But Newton was the first to propose an exact mathematical form and to use that form to show that the motion of heavenly bodies should be conic sections—circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas. This theoretical prediction was a major triumph. It had been known for some time that moons, planets, and comets follow such paths, but no one had been able to propose an explanation of the mechanism that caused them to follow these paths and not others.

***Figure 1** The popular legend that Newton suddenly discovered the law of universal gravitation when an apple fell from a tree and hit him on the head has an element of truth in it. A more probable account is that he was walking through an orchard and wondered why all the apples fell in the same direction with the same acceleration. Great importance is attached to it because Newton’s universal law of gravitation and his laws of motion answered very old questions about nature and gave tremendous support to the notion of underlying simplicity and unity in nature. Scientists still expect underlying simplicity to emerge from their ongoing inquiries into nature.*


The gravitational force is relatively simple. It is always attractive, and it depends only on the masses involved and the distance between them. Expressed in modern language,  states that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force that is directed along a line joining them. The force is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This attraction is illustrated by [Figure 2](#Figure_07_02_gravity).

![A figure shows a small circle and a large circle. A black line goes from one circle to the other. A red line with an arrow extends outward from each circle. The red lines have arrows on one end, pointing away from the circles, towards the midpoint of the space in between the circles.__ALT__Figure_07_02_gravity](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_07_02_gravity.jpg)
***Figure 2** Gravitational attraction is along a line joining the centers of mass (CM) of the two bodies. The magnitude of the force on each body is the same, consistent with Newton’s third law (action-reaction).*

For two bodies having masses *m* and *M* with a distance *r* between their centers of mass, the equation for Newton’s universal law of gravitation is

where **F** is the magnitude of the gravitational force and *G* is a proportionality factor called the . *G* is a universal constant, meaning that it is thought to be the same everywhere in the universe.

If a person has a mass of 60.0 kg, what would be the force of gravitational attraction on him at Earth’s surface? *G* is given above, Earth’s mass *M* is 5.97 × 10<sup>24</sup> kg, and the radius *r* of Earth is 6.38 × 10<sup>6</sup> m. Putting these values into Newton’s universal law of gravitation gives

This is a good point to recall the difference between mass and weight. Mass is the amount of matter in an object; weight is the force of attraction between the mass within two objects. Weight can change because *g* is different on every moon and planet. An object’s mass *m* does not change but its weight *m***g** can.

It is possible to derive Kepler’s third law from Newton’s law of universal gravitation. Applying Newton’s second law of motion to angular motion gives an expression for centripetal force, which can be equated to the expression for force in the universal gravitation equation. This expression can be manipulated to produce the equation for Kepler’s third law. We saw earlier that the expression *r<sup>3</sup>/T<sup>2</sup>* is a constant for satellites orbiting the same massive object. The derivation of Kepler’s third law from Newton’s law of universal gravitation and Newton’s second law of motion yields that constant:

<equation id="fs-id1167067175246" class="unnumbered"><label /> <math> <mrow>  <mfrac>   <mrow>    <msup>     <mi>r</mi>     <mn>3</mn>    </msup>    </mrow>   <mrow>    <msup>     <mi>T</mi>     <mn>2</mn>    </msup>    </mrow>  </mfrac>  <mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mrow>    <mi>G</mi><mi>M</mi></mrow>   <mrow>    <mn>4</mn><msup>     <mi>π</mi>     <mn>2</mn>    </msup>    </mrow>  </mfrac>  </mrow></math></equation>
where *M* is the mass of the central body about which the satellites orbit (for example, the sun in our solar system). The usefulness of this equation will be seen later.


The universal gravitational constant *G*is determined experimentally. This determination was first done accurately in 1798 by English scientist Henry Cavendish (1731–1810), more than 100 years after Newton published his universal law of gravitation. The measurement of *G*is very basic and important because it determines the strength of one of the four forces in nature. Cavendish’s experiment was very difficult because he measured the tiny gravitational attraction between two ordinary-sized masses (tens of kilograms at most) by using an apparatus like that in [Figure 3](#Figure_07_02_sphere). Remarkably, his value for *G*differs by less than 1% from the modern value.

![Apparatus consisting of two large spheres, one on each end of a horizontal rod centered on a pivot. Two smaller spheres are at the extremity of a smaller horizontal rod also centered on same pivot point. Light source shines laser beam that hits mirror and reflects onto scale to show pivot angle of spheres.__ALT__Figure_07_02_sphere](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_07_02_sphere.jpg)
***Figure 3** Cavendish used an apparatus like this to measure the gravitational attraction between two suspended spheres (*m*) and two spheres on a stand (*M*) by observing the amount of torsion (twisting) created in the fiber. The distance between the masses can be varied to check the dependence of the force on distance. Modern experiments of this type continue to explore gravity.*

### Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity
Einstein’s theory of general relativity explained some interesting properties of gravity not covered by Newton’s theory. Einstein based his theory on the postulate that acceleration and gravity have the same effect and cannot be distinguished from each other. He concluded that light must fall in both a gravitational field and in an accelerating reference frame. [Figure 4](#Figure_07_02_light) shows this effect (greatly exaggerated) in an accelerating elevator. In [Figure 4](#Figure_07_02_light) **(a)**, the elevator accelerates upward in zero gravity. In [Figure 4](#Figure_07_02_light) **(b)**, the room is not accelerating but is subject to gravity. The effect on light is the same: it “falls” downward in both situations. The person in the elevator cannot tell whether the elevator is accelerating in zero gravity or is stationary and subject to gravity. Thus, gravity affects the path of light, even though we think of gravity as acting between masses, while photons are massless.


![Left panel shows a person in an elevator who shines a light beam on the wall. Beam of light bends down. Elevator is labelled “accelerated up.” Right panel shows same picture, but person is in a room on Earth.__ALT__Figure_07_02_light](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_07_02_light.jpg)
***Figure 4** (a) A beam of light emerges from a flashlight in an upward-accelerating elevator. Since the elevator moves up during the time the light takes to reach the wall, the beam strikes lower than it would if the elevator were not accelerated. (b) Gravity must have the same effect on light, since it is not possible to tell whether the elevator is accelerating upward or is stationary and acted upon by gravity.*

Einstein’s theory of general relativity got its first verification in 1919 when starlight passing near the sun was observed during a solar eclipse. (See [Figure 5](#Figure_07_02_sun).) During an eclipse, the sky is darkened and we can briefly see stars. Those on a line of sight nearest the sun should have a shift in their apparent positions. Not only was this shift observed, but it agreed with Einstein’s predictions well within experimental uncertainties. This discovery created a scientific and public sensation. Einstein was now a folk hero as well as a very great scientist. The bending of light by matter is equivalent to a bending of space itself, with light following the curve. This is another radical change in our concept of space and time. It is also another connection that any particle with mass *or* energy (e.g., massless photons) is affected by gravity.

![Schematic drawing of sun at left and Earth at right. A person is standing on Earth. Two stars to left of sun. Lines drawn from starts to person’s eyes. Lower star has curved solid line, and upper star has straight dashed line.__ALT__Figure_07_02_sun](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_07_02_sun.jpg)
***Figure 5** This schematic shows how light passing near a massive body like the sun is curved toward it. The light that reaches the Earth then seems to be coming from different locations than the known positions of the originating stars. Not only was this effect observed, but the amount of bending was precisely what Einstein predicted in his general theory of relativity.*

To summarize the two views of gravity, Newton envisioned gravity as a tug of war along the line connecting any two objects in the universe. In contrast, Einstein envisioned gravity as a bending of space-time by mass.

The probe, shown in [Figure 6](#Figure_07_02_NASA) was launched in 2004. It carried four ultra-precise gyroscopes designed to measure two effects hypothesized by Einstein’s theory:

## Calculations Based on Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation
> When performing calculations using the equations in this chapter, use units of kilograms for mass, meters for distances, newtons for force, and seconds for time.
The mass of an object is constant, but its weight varies with the strength of the gravitational field. This means the value of **g** varies from place to place in the universe. The relationship between force, mass, and acceleration from the second law of motion can be written in terms of **g**.

<equation id="fs-id1167066839153" class="unnumbered"><label /> <math> <mrow>  <mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><mi>F</mi></mstyle><mo>=</mo><mi>m</mi><mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><mi>a</mi></mstyle><mo>=</mo><mi>m</mi><mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><mi>g</mi></mstyle></mrow></math></equation>
In this case, the force is the weight of the object, which is caused by the gravitational attraction of the planet or moon on which the object is located. We can use this expression to compare weights of an object on different moons and planets.

Several of the values in this equation are either constants or easily obtainable.  . Several of the values in this equation are either constants or easily obtainable. **F** is often the weight of an object on the surface of a large object with mass *M*, which is usually known. The mass of the smaller object, *m*, is often known, and *G* is a universal constant with the same value anywhere in the universe. This equation can be used to solve problems involving an object on or orbiting Earth or other massive celestial object. Sometimes it is helpful to equate the right-hand side of the equation to *m***g** and cancel the *m* on both sides.

Note that there is no need to know the mass of the object. Often, we know the radius   is also useful for problems involving objects in orbit. Note that there is no need to know the mass of the object. Often, we know the radius *r* or the period *T* and want to find the other. If these are both known, we can use the equation to calculate the mass of a planet or star.
