## Wave-Based Applications of Light

In 1917, Albert Einstein was thinking about photons and excited atoms. He considered an atom excited by a certain amount of energy and what would happen if that atom were hit by a photon with the same amount of energy. He suggested that the atom would emit a photon with that amount of energy, and it would be accompanied by the original photon. The exciting part is that you would have *two* photons with the same energy *and*they would be in phase. Those photons could go on to hit other excited atoms, and soon you would have a stream of in-phase photons. Such a light stream is said to be *coherent*. Some four decades later, Einstein’s idea found application in a process called, *light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation*. Take the first letters of all the words (except *by* and “of”) and write them in order. You get the word  (see [Figure __REPLACE_Figure_17_01_RayWave__](#Figure_17_01_RayWave) (a)), which is the name of the device that produces such a beam of light.

Laser beams are directional, very intense, and narrow (only about 0.5 mm in diameter). These properties lead to a number of applications in industry and medicine. The following are just a few examples:

* This chapter began with a picture of a compact disc (see [Figure __REPLACE_Figure_17_00_CDcolors__](#Figure_17_00_CDcolors)). Those audio and data-storage devices began replacing cassette tapes during the 1990s. CDs are read by interpreting variations in reflections of a laser beam from the surface.
* Some barcode scanners use a laser beam.
* Lasers are used in industry to cut steel and other metals.
* Lasers are bounced off reflectors that astronauts left on the Moon. The time it takes for the light to make the round trip can be used to make precise calculations of the Earth-Moon distance.
* Laser beams are used to produce holograms. The name hologram means *entire picture* (from the Greek *holo-*, as in *holistic*), because the image is three-dimensional. A viewer can move around the image and see it from different perspectives. Holograms take advantage of the wave properties of light, as opposed to traditional photography which is based on geometric optics. A holographic image is produced by constructive and destructive interference of a split laser beam.
* One of the advantages of using a laser as a surgical tool is that it is accompanied by very little bleeding.
* Laser eye surgery has improved the vision of many people, without the need for corrective lenses. A laser beam is used to change the shape of the lens of the eye, thus changing its focal length.

Change the energy of the incoming photons, and see if you can match it to an excitation level that will produce pairs of coherent photons. Change the excitation level and try to match it to the incoming photon energy.
> 
> In the animation there is only one excited atom. Is that the case for a real laser? Explain.
> 
> * No, a laser would have two excited atoms.
> * No, a laser would have several million excited atoms.
> * Yes, a laser would have only one excited atom.
> * No, a laser would have on the order of 10<sup>23</sup> excited atoms.
An interesting thing happens if you pass light through a large number of evenly-spaced parallel slits. Such an arrangement of slits is called a . An interference pattern is created that is very similar to the one formed by double-slit diffraction (see [Figure __REPLACE_Figure_17_01_2slit2__](#Figure_17_01_2slit2) and [Figure __REPLACE_Figure_17_01_2slit3__](#Figure_17_01_2slit3)). A diffraction grating can be manufactured by scratching glass with a sharp tool to form a number of precisely positioned parallel lines, which act like slits. Diffraction gratings work both for transmission of light, as in [Figure 1](#Figure_17_02_Grating), and for reflection of light, as on the butterfly wings or the Australian opal shown in [Figure 2](#Figure_17_02_Grating2), or the CD pictured in the opening [Figure __REPLACE_Figure_17_00_CDcolors__](#Figure_17_00_CDcolors) of this chapter. In addition to their use as novelty items, diffraction gratings are commonly used for spectroscopic dispersion and analysis of light. What makes them particularly useful is the fact that they form a sharper pattern than do double slits. That is, their bright regions are narrower and brighter, while their dark regions are darker. [Figure 3](#Figure_17_02_Grating3) shows idealized graphs demonstrating the sharper pattern. Natural diffraction gratings occur in the feathers of certain birds. Tiny, fingerlike structures in regular patterns act as reflection gratings, producing constructive interference that gives the feathers colors not solely due to their pigmentation. The effect is called .

Maxima can be produced at the same angles, but those for the diffraction grating are narrower, and hence sharper. The maxima become narrower and the regions between become darker as the number of slits is increased.*

> ### CD Players
> Can you see the grooves on a CD or DVD (see [Figure 4](#Figure_17_02_CD))? You may think you can because you know they are there, but they are extremely narrow—1,600 in a millimeter. Because the width of the grooves is similar to wavelengths of visible light, they form a diffraction grating. That is why you see rainbows on a CD. The colors are attractive, but they are incidental to the functions of storing and retrieving audio and other data.

> 
> The grooves are actually one continuous groove that spirals outward from the center. Data are recorded in the grooves as binary code (zeroes and ones) in small pits. Information in the pits is detected by a laser that tracks along the groove. It gets even more complicated: The speed of rotation must be varied as the laser tracks toward the circumference so that the linear speed along the groove remains constant. There is also an error correction mechanism to prevent the laser beam from getting off track. A diffraction grating is used to create the first two maxima on either side of the track. If those maxima are not the same distance from the track, an error is indicated and then corrected.

> ### Biology: DIC Microscopy
> If you were completely transparent, it would be hard to recognize you from your photograph. The same problem arises when using a traditional microscope to view or photograph small transparent objects such as cells and microbes. Microscopes using  solve the problem by making it possible to view microscopic objects with enhanced contrast, as shown in [Figure 5](#Figure_17_02_DIC).

Joined to the base of the stem of the Y are other pairs of branches that resemble the letter V, one above and one below, and both angled slightly to the left. Each arm of the V splits into two branches, and then again into very small branches. A mirror image of the Y and two V’s is to the right and the two Y stems are joined.__ALT__Figure_17_02_DIC](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_17_02_DIC.jpg)

> 
> A DIC microscope separates a polarized light source into two beams polarized at right angles to each other and coherent with each other, that is, in phase. After passing through the sample, the beams are recombined and realigned so they have the same plane of polarization. They then create an interference pattern caused by the differences in their optical path and the refractive indices of the parts of the sample they passed through. The result is an image with contrast and shadowing that could not be observed with traditional optics.
Where are diffraction gratings used? Diffraction gratings are key components of —devices that separate the various wavelengths of incoming light and allow a beam with only a specific wavelength to pass through. Monochromators are used, for example, in optical imaging of particular wavelengths from biological or medical samples. A diffraction grating can be chosen to specifically analyze a wavelength of light emitted by molecules in diseased cells in a biopsy sample, or to help excite strategic molecules in the sample with a selected frequency of light. Another important use is in optical fiber technologies where fibers are designed to provide optimum performance at specific wavelengths. A range of diffraction gratings is available for selecting specific wavelengths for such use.

Diffraction gratings are used in spectroscopes to separate a light source into its component wavelengths. When a material is heated to incandescence, it gives off wavelengths of light characteristic of the chemical makeup of the material. A pure substance will produce a spectrum that is unique, thus allowing identification of the substance. Spectroscopes are also used to measure wavelengths both shorter and longer than visible light. Such instruments have become especially useful to astronomers and chemists. [Figure 6](#Figure_17_02_Spectroscp) shows a diagram of a spectroscope.

![Drawing of a spectroscope. Drawing shows a flame, two mirrors, grating and detector. A yellow flame at the upper left is labeled “source.” A horizontal arrow from the source extends to a small circular arc, which is concave to the left and slightly downward. The arc is one of two that are labeled “mirrors.” A second arrow extends to the left and downward from the point where the first arrow strikes the mirror, and in turn strikes a rectangular object that is tilted from vertical slightly to the left. The object is labeled “grating.” From the point where the second arrow strikes the grating, a number of colored arrows fan out downward and to the right, forming a narrow triangle. Those arrows in turn strike the second circular arc, labeled as one of the “mirrors,” which is concave to the left and slightly upward. From the second mirror, five colored arrows fan out to the left and slightly downward to form a wider triangle, and they strike a vertical surface labeled “detector.” The purple arrow strikes the top of the detector and the blue arrow slightly below it. The green arrow strikes the middle of the detector, the yellow arrow slightly lower, and the red arrow the bottom of the detector.__ALT__Figure_17_02_Spectroscp](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_17_02_Spectroscp.jpg)
***Figure 6** The diagram shows the function of a diffraction grating in a spectroscope.*

Light diffracts as it moves through space, bending around obstacles and interfering constructively and destructively. While diffraction allows light to be used as a spectroscopic tool, it also limits the detail we can obtain in images.



[Figure 7](#Figure_17_02_Resolution) (a) shows the effect of passing light through a small circular aperture. Instead of a bright spot with sharp edges, a spot with a fuzzy edge surrounded by circles of light is obtained. This pattern is caused by diffraction similar to that produced by a single slit. Light from different parts of the circular aperture interferes constructively and destructively. The effect is most noticeable when the aperture is small, but the effect is there for large apertures, too.

![(a) A white circle on a black background is surrounded by a ring that fades outward from gray to black. (b) Two circles, one on the left and one on the right, are surrounded by gray rings. Their circumferences touch, but the circles are distinguishable. (c)Two circles, with surrounding gray rings, have moved closer together and now are indistinguishable. They form a horizontal oval.__ALT__Figure_17_02_Resolution](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_17_02_Resolution.jpg)
***Figure 7** (a) Monochromatic light passed through a small circular aperture produces this diffraction pattern. (b) Two point light sources that are close to one another produce overlapping images because of diffraction. (c) If they are closer together, they cannot be resolved, that is, distinguished.*

How does diffraction affect the detail that can be observed when light passes through an aperture? [Figure 7](#Figure_17_02_Resolution) (b) shows the diffraction pattern produced by two point light sources that are close to one another. The pattern is similar to that for a single point source, and it is just barely possible to tell that there are two light sources rather than one. If they are closer together, as in [Figure 7](#Figure_17_02_Resolution) (c), you cannot distinguish them, thus limiting the detail, or , you can obtain. That limit is an inescapable consequence of the wave nature of light.

There are many situations in which diffraction limits the resolution. The acuity of vision is limited because light passes through the pupil, the circular aperture of the eye. Be aware that the diffraction-like spreading of light is due to the limited diameter of a light beam, not the interaction with an aperture. Thus light passing through a lens with a diameter of *D*shows the diffraction effect and spreads, blurring the image, just as light passing through an aperture of diameter *D*does. Diffraction limits the resolution of any system having a lens or mirror. Telescopes are also limited by diffraction, because of the finite diameter, *D*, of their primary mirror.

## Calculations Involving Diffraction Gratings and Resolution

Early in the chapter, it was mentioned that when light passes from one medium to another, its speed and wavelength change, but its frequency remains constant. The equation


shows how to the wavelength in a given medium,  , is related to the wavelength in a vacuum,  , and the refractive index, *n*, of the medium. The equation is useful for calculating the change in wavelength of a monochromatic laser beam in various media. The analysis of a diffraction grating is very similar to that for a double slit. As you know from the discussion of double slits in Young’s double-slit experiment, light is diffracted by, and spreads out after passing through, each slit. Rays travel at an angle    relative to the incident direction. Each ray travels a different distance to a common point on a screen far away. The rays start in phase, and they can be in or out of phase when they reach a screen, depending on the difference in the path lengths traveled. Each ray travels a distance that differs by    from that of its neighbor, where *d*is the distance between slits. If    equals an integral number of wavelengths, the rays all arrive in phase, and constructive interference (a maximum) is obtained. Thus, the condition necessary to obtain constructive interference for a diffraction grating is


where *d* is the distance between slits in the grating,    is the wavelength of the light, and *m*is the order of the maximum. Note that this is exactly the same equation as for two slits separated by *d*. However, the slits are usually closer in diffraction gratings than in double slits, producing fewer maxima at larger angles.

Just what is the resolution limit of an aperture or lens? To answer that question, consider the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture, which, similar to the diffraction pattern of light passing through a slit, has a central maximum that is wider and brighter than the maxima surrounding it (see [Figure 7](#Figure_17_02_Resolution) (a)). It can be shown that, for a circular aperture of diameter *D*, the first minimum in the diffraction pattern occurs at  , provided that the aperture is large compared with the wavelength of light, which is the case for most optical instruments. The accepted criterion for determining the diffraction limit to resolution based on diffraction was developed by Lord Rayleigh in the 19th century. The  for the diffraction limit to resolution states that two images are just resolvable when the center of the diffraction pattern of one is directly over the first minimum of the diffraction pattern of the other. See [Figure 8](#Figure_17_02_Resolution2) (b). The first minimum is at an angle of  , so that two point objects are just resolvable if they are separated by the angle


where    is the wavelength of the light (or other electromagnetic radiation) and *D*is the diameter of the aperture, lens, mirror, etc., with which the two objects are observed. In the expression above,    has units of radians.

The central peak is largest, and it is labeled “intensity.” Four much smaller peaks are arranged symmetrically, two to the left and two to the right. An arrow below the horizontal axis points to the right and is labeled “theta.” Three points are labeled on the horizontal axis, “zero” for the central peak, “negative 1.22 lamda divided by D” for the valley on its left, and “1.22 lamda divided by D” for the valley on its right. (b) A drawing shows two lightbulbs at the bottom. One is labeled “Object 1,” and it is to the right and slightly above the other, labeled “Object 2.” In the middle of the drawing is a vertical screen with a circular hole in it. At the top of the drawing is a vertical screen with two wide peaks graphed on it, which are labeled “Intensities.” A line from Object 1 extends through the hole in the screen and strikes the horizontal axis of the graph directly below the left peak on the graph. Another line from Object two extends through the hole in the screen and strikes the horizontal axis of the graph directly below the right peak on the graph. The angle formed when the two lines cross (where they pass through the hole in the middle screen) is labeled “theta min.”__ALT__Figure_17_02_Resolution2](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_17_02_Resolutn2.jpg)
