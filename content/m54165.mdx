## The Graphical Method of Vector Addition and Subtraction
Recall that a vector is a quantity that has magnitude and direction. For example, displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force are all vectors. In one-dimensional or straight-line motion, the direction of a vector can be given simply by a plus or minus sign. Motion that is forward, to the right, or upward is usually considered to be *positive* (+); and motion that is backward, to the left, or downward is usually considered to be *negative* (−).

In two dimensions, a vector describes motion in two perpendicular directions, such as vertical and horizontal. For vertical and horizontal motion, each vector is made up of vertical and horizontal components. In a one-dimensional problem, one of the components simply has a value of zero. For two-dimensional vectors, we work with vectors by using a frame of reference such as a coordinate system. Just as with one-dimensional vectors, we graphically represent vectors with an arrow having a length proportional to the vector’s magnitude and pointing in the direction that the vector points.


[Figure 1](#Figure_05_01_city) shows a graphical representation of a vector; the total displacement for a person walking in a city. The person first walks nine blocks east and then five blocks north. Her total displacement does not match her path to her final destination. The displacement simply connects her starting point with her ending point using a straight line, which is the shortest distance. We use the notation that a boldface symbol, such as **D**, stands for a vector. Its magnitude is represented by the symbol in italics, *D*, and its direction is given by an angle represented by the symbol <math>      <mrow>        <mi>θ</mi><mo>.</mo>      </mrow>    </math> Note that her displacement would be the same if she had begun by first walking five blocks north and then walking nine blocks east. Note that her displacement would be the same if she had begun by first walking five blocks north and then walking nine blocks east.

> In this text, we represent a vector with a boldface variable. For example, we represent a force with the vector **F**, which has both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of the vector is represented by the variable in italics, *F*, and the direction of the variable is given by the angle <math>        <mrow>          <mi>θ</mi><mo>.</mo>        </mrow>      </math>

The y-axis represents north and has a scale from zero to five in increments of one. Lines show that a person walks nine blocks east and five blocks north. A displacement vector is plotted from the origin to the destination of nine, five on the axes.__ALT__Figure_05_01_city](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_05_01_city.jpg)

The  is a  way to add vectors. The  of the vector is the starting point of the vector, and the  (or tip) of a vector is the pointed end of the arrow. The following steps describe how to use the head-to-tail method for graphical .

* Let the *x*-axis represent the east-west direction. Using a ruler and protractor, draw an arrow to represent the first vector (nine blocks to the east), as shown in [Figure 2](#Figure_05_01_vectora)[Figure 2](#Figure_05_01_vectora).

***Figure 2** The diagram shows a vector with a magnitude of nine units and a direction of 0°.*
* Let the *y*-axis represent the north-south direction. Draw an arrow to represent the second vector (five blocks to the north). Place the tail of the second vector at the head of the first vector, as shown in [Figure 3](#Figure_05_01_vectorb)[Figure 3](#Figure_05_01_vectorb).

***Figure 3** A vertical vector is added.*
* If there are more than two vectors, continue to add the vectors head-to-tail as described in step 2. In this example, we have only two vectors, so we have finished placing arrows tip to tail.
* Draw an arrow from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector, as shown in [Figure 4](#Figure_05_01_vectorc)[Figure 4](#Figure_05_01_vectorc). This is the , or the sum, of the vectors.

* To find the direction of the resultant, use a protractor to measure the angle it makes with the reference direction (in this case, the *x*-axis). When we deal with vectors analytically in the next section, the direction will be calculated by using trigonometry to find the angle.

is done in the same way as vector addition with one small change. We add the first vector to the negative of the vector that needs to be subtracted. A negative vector has the same magnitude as the original vector, but points in the opposite direction (as shown in [Figure 5](#Figure_05_01_negative)). Subtracting the vector **B** from the vector **A**, which is written as **A** − **B**, is the same as **A** + (−**B**). Since it does not matter in what order vectors are added, **A** − **B** is also equal to (−**B**) + **A**. This is true for scalars as well as vectors. For example, 5 – 2 = 5 + (−2) = (−2) + 5.

![Two vectors are shown. Vector B points upward at an angle. Vector negative B is parallel to vector B and points downward.__ALT__Figure_05_01_negative](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_05_01_negative.jpg)

Global angles are calculated in the counterclockwise direction. The clockwise direction is considered negative.

## Using the Graphical Method of Vector Addition and Subtraction to Solve Physics Problems
Now that we have the skills to work with vectors in two dimensions, we can apply vector addition to graphically determine the , which represents the total force. Consider an example of force involving two ice skaters pushing a third as seen in [Figure 6](#Figure_05_01_skaters).

![Two diagrams are shown. Diagram a is an overhead view of two skaters, one on the left and one below, pushing on a third skater in the center. A force vector is shown on each of the pushing skaters pointing from the skater's shoulder to the skater in the center. A right triangle is drawn using the force vectors, with F tot as the hypotenuse, F one as the bottom leg, and F two as the right leg. Diagram b is a free body diagram with F one pointing to the right and F two pointing up. Both vectors have the same magnitude.__ALT__Figure_05_01_skaters](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_05_01_skaters.jpg)
***Figure 6** Part (a) shows an overhead view of two ice skaters pushing on a third. Forces are vectors and add like vectors, so the total force on the third skater is in the direction shown. In part (b), we see a free-body diagram representing the forces acting on the third skater.*

In problems where variables such as force are already known, the forces can be represented by making the length of the vectors proportional to the magnitudes of the forces. For this, you need to create a scale. For example, each centimeter of vector length could represent 50 N worth of force. Once you have the initial vectors drawn to scale, you can then use the head-to-tail method to draw the resultant vector. The length of the resultant can then be measured and converted back to the original units using the scale you created.

You can tell by looking at the vectors in the free-body diagram in [Figure 6](#Figure_05_01_skaters) that the two skaters are pushing on the third skater with equal-magnitude forces, since the length of their force vectors are the same. Note, however, that the forces are not equal because they act in different directions. If, for example, each force had a magnitude of 400 N, then we would find the magnitude of the total external force acting on the third skater by finding the magnitude of the resultant vector. Since the forces act at a right angle to one another, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. For a triangle with sides a, b, and c, the Pythagorean theorem tells us that

Applying this theorem to the triangle made by **F**, **F**, and **F** in [Figure 6](#Figure_05_01_skaters), we get

> ### Vector Addition
> In , you will experiment with adding vectors graphically. Click and drag the red vectors from the Grab One basket onto the graph in the middle of the screen. These red vectors can be rotated, stretched, or repositioned by clicking and dragging with your mouse. Check the Show Sum box to display the resultant vector (in green), which is the sum of all of the red vectors placed on the graph. To remove a red vector, drag it to the trash or click the Clear All button if you wish to start over. Notice that, if you click on any of the vectors, the <math>        <mrow>          <mrow><mo>|</mo> <mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><mi>R</mi></mstyle> <mo>|</mo></mrow>        </mrow>      </math> is its magnitude,  is its magnitude, <math>        <mrow>          <mi>θ</mi>        </mrow>      </math> is its direction with respect to the positive  is its direction with respect to the positive *x*-axis, **R** is its horizontal component, and *R* is its vertical component. You can check the resultant by lining up the vectors so that the head of the first vector touches the tail of the second. Continue until all of the vectors are aligned together head-to-tail. You will see that the resultant magnitude and angle is the same as the arrow drawn from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector. Rearrange the vectors in any order head-to-tail and compare. The resultant will always be the same.
