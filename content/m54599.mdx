## The Role of Units
Physicists, like other scientists, make observations and ask basic questions. For example, how big is an object? How much mass does it have? How far did it travel? To answer these questions, they make measurements with various instruments (e.g., meter stick, balance, stopwatch, etc.).

The measurements of physical quantities are expressed in terms of units, which are standardized values. For example, the length of a race, which is a physical quantity, can be expressed in meters (for sprinters) or kilometers (for long distance runners). Without standardized units, it would be extremely difficult for scientists to express and compare measured values in a meaningful way ([Figure 1](#Figure_01_03_map)).

***Figure 1** Distances given in unknown units are maddeningly useless.*

All physical quantities in the International System of Units (SI) are expressed in terms of combinations of seven  units, which are units for: length, mass, time, electric current, temperature, amount of a substance, and luminous intensity.

## SI Units: Fundamental and Derived Units
In any system of units, the units for some physical quantities must be defined through a measurement process. These are called the  for that system and their units are the system’s . All other physical quantities can then be expressed as algebraic combinations of the base quantities. Each of these physical quantities is then known as a  and each unit is called a . The choice of base quantities is somewhat arbitrary, as long as they are independent of each other and all other quantities can be derived from them. Typically, the goal is to choose physical quantities that can be measured accurately to a high precision as the base quantities. The reason for this is simple. Since the derived units can be expressed as algebraic combinations of the base units, they can only be as accurate and precise as the base units from which they are derived.


Based on such considerations, the International Standards Organization recommends using seven base quantities, which form the International System of Quantities (ISQ). These are the base quantities used to define the SI base units. ([Figure __REPLACE_Table_01_03_SIUnits__](#Table_01_03_SIUnits)) lists these seven ISQ base quantities and the corresponding SI base units.

### The Meter
The SI unit for length is the **meter** (m). The definition of the meter has changed over time to become more accurate and precise. The meter was first defined in 1791 as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole. This measurement was improved in 1889 by redefining the meter to be the distance between two engraved lines on a platinum-iridium bar. (The bar is now housed at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, near Paris). By 1960, some distances could be measured more precisely by comparing them to wavelengths of light. The meter was redefined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of orange light emitted by krypton atoms. In 1983, the meter was given its present definition as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/ 299,792,458 of a second ([Figure 2](#Figure_01_03_flashlight)).

![A shining flashlight is placed over top a meter stick to illustrate that the meter is defined as the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second through a vacuum.__ALT__Figure_01_03_flashlight](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_01_03_flashlight.jpg)
***Figure 2** The meter is defined to be the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second through a vacuum. Distance traveled is speed multiplied by time.*

### The Kilogram
The SI unit for mass is the **kilogram** (abbreviated kg); it was previously defined to be the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder kept with the old meter standard at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. Exact replicas of the previously defined kilogram are also kept at the United States’ National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, located in Gaithersburg, Maryland outside of Washington D.C., and at other locations around the world. The determination of all other masses could be ultimately traced to a comparison with the standard mass. Even though the platinum-iridium cylinder was resistant to corrosion, airborne contaminants were able to adhere to its surface, slightly changing its mass over time. In May 2019, the scientific community adopted a more stable definition of the kilogram. The kilogram is now defined in terms of the second, the meter, and Planck's constant, *h* (a quantum mechanical value that relates a photon's energy to its frequency).

### The Second
The SI unit for time, the **second** (s) also has a long history. For many years it was defined as 1/86,400 of an average solar day. However, the average solar day is actually very gradually getting longer due to gradual slowing of Earth’s rotation. Accuracy in the fundamental units is essential, since all other measurements are derived from them. Therefore, a new standard was adopted to define the second in terms of a non-varying, or constant, physical phenomenon. One constant phenomenon is the very steady vibration of Cesium atoms, which can be observed and counted. This vibration forms the basis of the . In 1967, the second was redefined as the time required for 9,192,631,770 Cesium atom vibrations ([Figure 3](#Figure_01_03_clock)).

### The Ampere
Electric current is measured in the **ampere** (A), named after Andre Ampere. You have probably heard of amperes, or *amps*, when people discuss electrical currents or electrical devices. Understanding an ampere requires a basic understanding of electricity and magnetism, something that will be explored in depth in later chapters of this book. Basically, two parallel wires with an electric current running through them will produce an attractive force on each other. One ampere is defined as the amount of electric current that will produce an attractive force of 2.7    10<sup>–7</sup> newton per meter of separation between the two wires (the newton is the derived unit of force).


### Kelvins
The SI unit of temperature is the  (or kelvins, but not degrees kelvin). This scale is named after physicist William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, who was the first to call for an absolute temperature scale. The Kelvin scale is based on absolute zero. This is the point at which all thermal energy has been removed from all atoms or molecules in a system. This temperature, 0 K, is equal to −273.15 °C and −459.67 °F. Conveniently, the Kelvin scale actually changes in the same way as the Celsius scale. For example, the freezing point (0 °C) and boiling points of water (100 °C) are 100 degrees apart on the Celsius scale. These two temperatures are also 100 kelvins apart (freezing point = 273.15 K; boiling point = 373.15 K).

### Metric Prefixes
Physical objects or phenomena may vary widely. For example, the size of objects varies from something very small (like an atom) to something very large (like a star). Yet the standard metric unit of length is the meter. So, the metric system includes many prefixes that can be attached to a unit. Each prefix is based on factors of 10 (10, 100, 1,000, etc., as well as 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, etc.). [Figure __REPLACE_Table_01_03_Metrics__](#Table_01_03_Metrics) gives the metric prefixes and symbols used to denote the different various factors of 10 in the metric system.

The  is convenient because conversions between  can be done simply by moving the decimal place of a number. This is because the metric prefixes are sequential powers of 10. There are 100 centimeters in a meter, 1000 meters in a kilometer, and so on. In nonmetric systems, such as , the relationships are less simple—there are 12 inches in a foot, 5,280 feet in a mile, 4 quarts in a gallon, and so on. Another advantage of the metric system is that the same unit can be used over extremely large ranges of values simply by switching to the most-appropriate metric prefix. For example, distances in meters are suitable for building construction, but kilometers are used to describe road construction. Therefore, with the metric system, there is no need to invent new units when measuring very small or very large objects—you just have to move the decimal point (and use the appropriate prefix).

### Known Ranges of Length, Mass, and Time
[Figure __REPLACE_Table_01_03_Units__](#Table_01_03_Units) lists known lengths, masses, and time measurements. You can see that scientists use a range of measurement units. This wide range demonstrates the vastness and complexity of the universe, as well as the breadth of phenomena physicists study. As you examine this table, note how the metric system allows us to discuss and compare an enormous range of phenomena, using one system of measurement ([Figure 4](#Figure_01_03_plankton) and [Figure 5](#Figure_01_03_stars)).

## Using Scientific Notation with Physical Measurements
is a way of writing numbers that are too large or small to be conveniently written as a decimal. For example, consider the number 840,000,000,000,000. It’s a rather large number to write out. The scientific notation for this number is 8.40    10<sup>14</sup>. Scientific notation follows this general format


In this format *x* is the value of the measurement with all placeholder zeros removed. In the example above, *x* is 8.4. The *x* is multiplied by a factor, 10*<sup>y</sup>*, which indicates the number of placeholder zeros in the measurement. Placeholder zeros are those at the end of a number that is 10 or greater, and at the beginning of a decimal number that is less than 1. In the example above, the factor is 10<sup>14</sup>. This tells you that you should move the decimal point 14 positions to the right, filling in placeholder zeros as you go. In this case, moving the decimal point 14 places creates only 13 placeholder zeros, indicating that the actual measurement value is 840,000,000,000,000.

Numbers that are fractions can be indicated by scientific notation as well. Consider the number 0.0000045. Its scientific notation is 4.5    10<sup>–6</sup>. Its scientific notation has the same format


Here, *x* is 4.5. However, the value of *y* in the 10<sup>*y*</sup> factor is negative, which indicates that the measurement is a fraction of 1. Therefore, we move the decimal place to the left, for a negative *y*. In our example of 4.5    10<sup>–6</sup>, the decimal point would be moved to the left six times to yield the original number, which would be 0.0000045.

The term  refers to the power of 10 when numbers are expressed in scientific notation. Quantities that have the same power of 10 when expressed in scientific notation, or come close to it, are said to be of the same order of magnitude. For example, the number 800 can be written as 8    10<sup>2</sup>, and the number 450 can be written as 4.5    10<sup>2</sup>. Both numbers have the same value for *y*. Therefore, 800 and 450 are of the same order of magnitude. Similarly, 101 and 99 would be regarded as the same order of magnitude, 10<sup>2</sup>. Order of magnitude can be thought of as a ballpark estimate for the scale of a value. The diameter of an atom is on the order of 10<sup>−9</sup> m, while the diameter of the sun is on the order of 10<sup>9</sup> m. These two values are 18 orders of magnitude apart.

Scientists make frequent use of scientific notation because of the vast range of physical measurements possible in the universe, such as the distance from Earth to the moon ([Figure 6](#Figure_01_03_world)), or to the nearest star.

![A photograph taken from the moon shows Earth in the distance.__ALT__Figure_01_03_world](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_01_03_world.jpg)
***Figure 6** The distance from Earth to the moon may seem immense, but it is just a tiny fraction of the distance from Earth to our closest neighboring star. (NASA)*

### Unit Conversion and Dimensional Analysis
It is often necessary to convert from one type of unit to another. For example, if you are reading a European cookbook in the United States, some quantities may be expressed in liters and you need to convert them to cups. A Canadian tourist driving through the United States might want to convert miles to kilometers, to have a sense of how far away his next destination is. A doctor in the United States might convert a patient’s weight in pounds to kilograms.

Let’s consider a simple example of how to convert units within the metric system. How can we convert 1 hour to seconds?

First, we need to determine a conversion factor. A  is a ratio expressing how many of one unit are equal to another unit. A conversion factor is simply a fraction which equals 1. You can multiply any number by 1 and get the same value. When you multiply a number by a conversion factor, you are simply multiplying it by one. For example, the following are conversion factors: (1 foot)/(12 inches) = 1 to convert inches to feet, (1 meter)/(100 centimeters) = 1 to convert centimeters to meters, (1 minute)/(60 seconds) = 1 to convert seconds to minutes.

Now we can set up our unit conversion. We will write the units that we have and then multiply them by the conversion factor (1 km/1,000m) = 1, so we are simply multiplying 80m by 1:


When there is a unit in the original number, and a unit in the denominator (bottom) of the conversion factor, the units cancel. In this case, hours and minutes cancel and the value in seconds remains.

You can use this method to convert between any types of unit, including between the U.S. customary system and metric system. Notice also that, although you can multiply and divide units algebraically, you cannot add or subtract different units. An expression like *10 km + 5 kg* makes no sense. Even adding two lengths in different units, such as *10 km + 20 m* does not make sense. You express both lengths in the same unit. See  for a more complete list of conversion factors.

## Accuracy, Precision and Significant Figures
Science is based on experimentation that requires good measurements. The validity of a measurement can be described in terms of its accuracy and its precision (see [Figure 7](#Figure_01_03_pan) and [Figure 8](#Figure_01_03_balance)).  is how close a measurement is to the correct value for that measurement. For example, let us say that you are measuring the length of standard piece of printer paper. The packaging in which you purchased the paper states that it is 11 inches long, and suppose this stated value is correct. You measure the length of the paper three times and obtain the following measurements: 11.1 inches, 11.2 inches, and 10.9 inches. These measurements are quite accurate because they are very close to the correct value of 11.0 inches. In contrast, if you had obtained a measurement of 12 inches, your measurement would not be very accurate. This is why measuring instruments are calibrated based on a known measurement. If the instrument consistently returns the correct value of the known measurement, it is safe for use in finding unknown values.

![A double-pan mechanical balance is shown. A metal mass is sitting in the left pan.__ALT__Figure_01_03_pan](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_01_03_pan.jpg)
***Figure 7** A double-pan mechanical balance is used to compare different masses. Usually an object with unknown mass is placed in one pan and objects of known mass are placed in the other pan. When the bar that connects the two pans is horizontal, then the masses in both pans are equal. The known masses are typically metal cylinders of standard mass such as 1 gram, 10 grams, and 100 grams. (Serge Melki)*

![A plastic pen cap is sitting on a digital scale and has a measured mass of 0.98 grams.__ALT__Figure_01_03_balance](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_01_03_balance.jpg)
***Figure 8** Whereas a mechanical balance may only read the mass of an object to the nearest tenth of a gram, some digital scales can measure the mass of an object up to the nearest thousandth of a gram. As in other measuring devices, the precision of a scale is limited to the last measured figures. This is the hundredths place in the scale pictured here. (Splarka, Wikimedia Commons)*

states how well repeated measurements of something generate the same or similar results. Therefore, the precision of measurements refers to how close together the measurements are when you measure the same thing several times. One way to analyze the precision of measurements would be to determine the range, or difference between the lowest and the highest measured values. In the case of the printer paper measurements, the lowest value was 10.9 inches and the highest value was 11.2 inches. Thus, the measured values deviated from each other by, at most, 0.3 inches. These measurements were reasonably precise because they varied by only a fraction of an inch. However, if the measured values had been 10.9 inches, 11.1 inches, and 11.9 inches, then the measurements would not be very precise because there is a lot of variation from one measurement to another.

The measurements in the paper example are both accurate and precise, but in some cases, measurements are accurate but not precise, or they are precise but not accurate. Let us consider a GPS system that is attempting to locate the position of a restaurant in a city. Think of the restaurant location as existing at the center of a bull’s-eye target. Then think of each GPS attempt to locate the restaurant as a black dot on the bull’s eye.

In [Figure 9](#Figure_01_03_target_accuracy), you can see that the GPS measurements are spread far apart from each other, but they are all relatively close to the actual location of the restaurant at the center of the target. This indicates a low precision, high accuracy measuring system. However, in [Figure 10](#Figure_01_03_target_precision), the GPS measurements are concentrated quite closely to one another, but they are far away from the target location. This indicates a high precision, low accuracy measuring system. Finally, in [Figure 11](#Figure_01_03_target_both), the GPS is both precise and accurate, allowing the restaurant to be located.

![A red target is shown with four dots that are spread out around the outer center ring, or bull's eye.

The accuracy and precision of a measuring system determine the  of its measurements. Uncertainty is a way to describe your confidence in your measured value, or the range of values that would be consistent with the data. If your measurements are not very accurate or precise, then the uncertainty of your values will be very high. In more general terms, uncertainty can be thought of as a disclaimer for your measured values. For example, if someone asked you to provide the mileage on your car, you might say that it is 45,000 miles, plus or minus 500 miles. The plus or minus amount is the uncertainty in your value. That is, you are indicating that the actual mileage of your car might be as low as 44,500 miles or as high as 45,500 miles, or anywhere in between. All measurements contain some amount of uncertainty. In our example of measuring the length of the paper, we might say that the length of the paper is 11 inches plus or minus 0.2 inches or 11.0 ± 0.2 inches. The uncertainty in a measurement, *A*, is often denoted as *δA* ("delta *A*"). The actual value of the object may not be within the range given by the measurement and its uncertainty. In our paper length example above, a new set of measurements might produce a length of 14.0 ± 0.2 inches, with the uncertainty based on the accuracy or our reading or repeated measurements. We would also, however, conclude that either one of our measurement sets is incorrect due to an offset in the measurement process in that set, or our measurement correctly identifies that we are measuring  different papers. In the former case, the discrepancy between the measured value and the actual value is called a systematic error.

The factors contributing to uncertainty in a measurement include the following:

* Limitations of the measuring device
* The skill of the person making the measurement
* Irregularities in the object being measured
* Any other factors that affect the outcome (highly dependent on the situation)
In the printer paper example uncertainty could be caused by: the fact that the smallest division on the ruler is 0.1 inches, the person using the ruler has bad eyesight, or uncertainty caused by the paper cutting machine (e.g., one side of the paper is slightly longer than the other.) It is good practice to carefully consider all possible sources of uncertainty in a measurement and reduce or eliminate them.

### Percent Uncertainty
One method of expressing uncertainty is as a percent of the measured value. If a measurement, *A*, is expressed with uncertainty, δ*A*, the percent uncertainty is

### Uncertainty in Calculations
There is an uncertainty in anything calculated from measured quantities. For example, the area of a floor calculated from measurements of its length and width has an uncertainty because the both the length and width have uncertainties. How big is the uncertainty in something you calculate by multiplication or division? If the measurements in the calculation have small uncertainties (a few percent or less), then the  can be used. This method says that the percent uncertainty in a quantity calculated by multiplication or division is the sum of the percent uncertainties in the items used to make the calculation. For example, if a floor has a length of 4.00 m and a width of 3.00 m, with uncertainties of 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively, then the area of the floor is 12.0 m<sup>2</sup> and has an uncertainty of 3 percent (expressed as an area this is 0.36 m<sup>2</sup>, which we round to 0.4 m<sup>2</sup> since the area of the floor is given to a tenth of a square meter).

### Precision of Measuring Tools and Significant Figures
An important factor in the accuracy and precision of measurements is the precision of the measuring tool. In general, a precise measuring tool is one that can measure values in very small increments. For example, consider measuring the thickness of a coin. A standard ruler can measure thickness to the nearest millimeter, while a micrometer can measure the thickness to the nearest 0.005 millimeter. The micrometer is a more precise measuring tool because it can measure extremely small differences in thickness. The more precise the measuring tool, the more precise and accurate the measurements can be.

When we express measured values, we can only list as many digits as we initially measured with our measuring tool (such as the rulers shown in [Figure 12](#Figure_01_03_rulers)). For example, if you use a standard ruler to measure the length of a stick, you may measure it with a decimeter ruler as 3.6 cm. You could not express this value as 3.65 cm because your measuring tool was not precise enough to measure a hundredth of a centimeter. It should be noted that the last digit in a measured value has been estimated in some way by the person performing the measurement. For example, the person measuring the length of a stick with a ruler notices that the stick length seems to be somewhere in between 36 mm and 37 mm. He or she must estimate the value of the last digit. The rule is that the last digit written down in a measurement is the first digit with some uncertainty. For example, the last measured value 36.5 mm has three digits, or three significant figures. The number of  in a measurement indicates the precision of the measuring tool. The more precise a measuring tool is, the greater the number of significant figures it can report.

![The stick can be measured with increasing accuracy as we use smaller and smaller scales of measurement.__ALT__Figure_01_03_rulers](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_01_03_rulers.jpg)
***Figure 12** Three metric rulers are shown. The first ruler is in decimeters and can measure point three decimeters. The second ruler is in centimeters long and can measure three point six centimeters. The last ruler is in millimeters and can measure thirty-six point five millimeters.*

### Zeros
Special consideration is given to zeros when counting significant figures. For example, the zeros in 0.053 are not significant because they are only placeholders that locate the decimal point. There are two significant figures in 0.053—the 5 and the 3. However, if the zero occurs between other significant figures, the zeros are significant. For example, both zeros in 10.053 are significant, as these zeros were actually measured. Therefore, the 10.053 placeholder has five significant figures. The zeros in 1300 may or may not be significant, depending on the style of writing numbers. They could mean the number is known to the last zero, or the zeros could be placeholders. So 1300 could have two, three, or four significant figures. To avoid this ambiguity, write 1300 in scientific notation as 1.3 × 10<sup>3</sup>. Only significant figures are given in the *x* factor for a number in scientific notation (in the form   ). Therefore, we know that 1 and 3 are the only significant digits in this number. In summary, zeros are significant except when they serve only as placeholders. [Figure __REPLACE_Table_10_03_sigfigs__](#Table_10_03_sigfigs) provides examples of the number of significant figures in various numbers.

### Significant Figures in Calculations
When combining measurements with different degrees of accuracy and precision, the number of significant digits in the final answer can be no greater than the number of significant digits in the least precise measured value. There are two different rules, one for multiplication and division and another rule for addition and subtraction, as discussed below.

* **For multiplication and division:** The answer should have the same number of significant figures as the starting value with the fewest significant figures. For example, the area of a circle can be calculated from its radius using   . Let us see how many significant figures the area will have if the radius has only two significant figures, for example, *r* = 2.0 m. Then, using a calculator that keeps eight significant figures, you would get


But because the radius has only two significant figures, the area calculated is meaningful only to two significant figures or


even though the value of    is meaningful to at least eight digits.
* **For addition and subtraction**: The answer should have the same number places (e.g. tens place, ones place, tenths place, etc.) as the least-precise starting value. Suppose that you buy 7.56 kg of potatoes in a grocery store as measured with a scale having a precision of 0.01 kg. Then you drop off 6.052 kg of potatoes at your laboratory as measured by a scale with a precision of 0.001 kg. Finally, you go home and add 13.7 kg of potatoes as measured by a bathroom scale with a precision of 0.1 kg. How many kilograms of potatoes do you now have, and how many significant figures are appropriate in the answer? The mass is found by simple addition and subtraction:
The least precise measurement is 13.7 kg. This measurement is expressed to the 0.1 decimal place, so our final answer must also be expressed to the 0.1 decimal place. Thus, the answer should be rounded to the tenths place, giving 15.2 kg. The same is true for non-decimal numbers. For example,

We cannot report the decimal places in the answer because *2* has no decimal places that would be significant. Therefore, we can only report to the ones place.

It is a good idea to keep extra significant figures while calculating, and to round off to the correct number of significant figures only in the final answers. The reason is that small errors from rounding while calculating can sometimes produce significant errors in the final answer. As an example, try calculating    to obtain a final answer to only two significant figures. Keeping all significant during the calculation gives 48. Rounding to two significant figures in the middle of the calculation changes it to    which is way off. You would similarly avoid rounding in the middle of the calculation in counting and in doing accounting, where many small numbers need to be added and subtracted accurately to give possibly much larger final numbers.

### Significant Figures in this Text
In this textbook, most numbers are assumed to have three significant figures. Furthermore, consistent numbers of significant figures are used in all worked examples. You will note that an answer given to three digits is based on input good to at least three digits. If the input has fewer significant figures, the answer will also have fewer significant figures. Care is also taken that the number of significant figures is reasonable for the situation posed. In some topics, such as optics, more than three significant figures will be used. Finally, if a number is exact, such as the *2* in the formula,  , it does not affect the number of significant figures in a calculation.

In the example above, the final approximate value is much higher than the first friend’s early estimate of 3 in. However, the other friend’s early estimate of 10 ft. (120 in.) was roughly correct. How did the approximation measure up to your first guess? What can this exercise suggest about the value of rough *guesstimates* versus carefully calculated approximations?


## Graphing in Physics
Most results in science are presented in scientific journal articles using graphs. Graphs present data in a way that is easy to visualize for humans in general, especially someone unfamiliar with what is being studied. They are also useful for presenting large amounts of data or data with complicated trends in an easily-readable way.

One commonly-used graph in physics and other sciences is the , probably because it is the best graph for showing how one quantity changes in response to the other. Let’s build a line graph based on the data in [Figure __REPLACE_Table_01_03_train__](#Table_01_03_train), which shows the measured distance that a train travels from its station versus time. Our two , or things that change along the graph, are time in minutes, and distance from the station, in kilometers. Remember that measured data may not have perfect accuracy.

* Draw the two axes. The horizontal axis, or *x*-axis, shows the , which is the variable that is controlled or manipulated. The vertical axis, or *y*-axis, shows the , the non-manipulated variable that changes with (or is dependent on) the value of the independent variable. In the data above, time is the independent variable and should be plotted on the *x*-axis. Distance from the station is the dependent variable and should be plotted on the *y*-axis.
* Label each axes on the graph with the name of each variable, followed by the symbol for its units in parentheses. Be sure to leave room so that you can number each axis. In this example, use *Time (min)* as the label for the *x*-axis.
* Next, you must determine the best scale to use for numbering each axis. Because the time values on the *x*-axis are taken every 10 minutes, we could easily number the *x*-axis from 0 to 70 minutes with a tick mark every 10 minutes. Likewise, the *y*-axis scale should start low enough and continue high enough to include all of the *distance from station* values. A scale from 0 km to 160 km should suffice, perhaps with a tick mark every 10 km.

In general, you want to pick a scale for both axes that 1) shows all of your data, and 2) makes it easy to identify trends in your data. If you make your scale too large, it will be harder to see how your data change. Likewise, the smaller and more fine you make your scale, the more space you will need to make the graph. The number of significant figures in the axis values should be coarser than the number of significant figures in the measurements.
* Now that your axes are ready, you can begin plotting your data. For the first data point, count along the *x*-axis until you find the 10 min tick mark. Then, count up from that point to the 10 km tick mark on the *y*-axis, and approximate where 22 km is along the *y*-axis. Place a dot at this location. Repeat for the other six data points ([Figure 13](#Figure_01_03_point)).
![A graph titled Train Motion with plotted points is shown. The x-axis is labeled Time in minutes and has a scale from zero to seventy in increments of ten. The y-axis is labeled Distance from station in kilometers and has a scale from zero to one hundred sixty in increments of twenty. The following points are plotted: zero, zero; ten, twenty-two; twenty, thirty-eight; thirty, sixty; forty, eighty-two; fifty, ninety-eight; sixty, one-hundred eighteen; seventy, one-hundred forty.__ALT__Figure_01_03_point](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_01_03_point.jpg)
***Figure 13** The graph of the train’s distance from the station versus time from the exercise above.*
* Add a title to the top of the graph to state what the graph is describing, such as the *y*-axis parameter vs. the *x*-axis parameter. In the graph shown here, the title is *train motion*. It could also be titled distance of the train from the station vs. time.
* Finally, with data points now on the graph, you should draw a trend line ([Figure 14](#Figure_01_03_trendline)). The trend line represents the dependence you think the graph represents, so that the person who looks at your graph can see how close it is to the real data. In the present case, since the data points look like they ought to fall on a straight line, you would draw a straight line as the trend line. Draw it to come closest to all the points. Real data may have some inaccuracies, and the plotted points may not all fall on the trend line. In some cases, none of the data points fall exactly on the trend line.

### Analyzing a Graph Using Its Equation
One way to get a quick snapshot of a dataset is to look at the equation of its . If the graph produces a straight line, the equation of the trend line takes the form


The *b* in the equation is the *y*-intercept while the *m* in the equation is the . The *y*-intercept tells you at what *y* value the line intersects the *y*-axis. In the case of the graph above, the *y*-intercept occurs at 0, at the very beginning of the graph. The *y*-intercept, therefore, lets you know immediately where on the *y*-axis the plot line begins.

The *m*in the equation is the slope. This value describes how much the line on the graph moves up or down on the *y*-axis along the line’s length. The slope is found using the following equation


In order to solve this equation, you need to pick two points on the line (preferably far apart on the line so the slope you calculate describes the line accurately). The quantities *Y* and *Y* represent the *y*-values from the two points on the line (not data points) that you picked, while *X* and *X* represent the two *x*-values of the those points.

What can the slope value tell you about the graph? The slope of a perfectly horizontal line will equal zero, while the slope of a perfectly vertical line will be undefined because you cannot divide by zero. A positive slope indicates that the line moves up the *y*-axis as the *x*-value increases while a negative slope means that the line moves down the *y*-axis. The more negative or positive the slope is, the steeper the line moves up or down, respectively. The slope of our graph in [Figure 13](#Figure_01_03_point) is calculated below based on the two endpoints of the line


Equation of line:

Because the *x*axis is time in minutes, we would actually be more likely to use the time *t*as the independent (*x-*axis) variable and write the equation as


The formula    only applies to , or ones that produce a straight line. Another common type of line in physics is the , which occurs when one of the variables is squared. One quadratic relationship in physics is the relation between the speed of an object its centripetal acceleration, which is used to determine the force needed to keep an object moving in a circle. Another common relationship in physics is the , in which one variable decreases whenever the other variable increases. An example in physics is Coulomb’s law. As the distance between two charged objects increases, the electrical force between the two charged objects decreases. , such the relation between *x* and *y* in the equation


for some number *k*, is one particular kind of inverse relationship. A third commonly-seen relationship is the , in which a change in the independent variable produces a proportional change in the dependent variable. As the value of the dependent variable gets larger, its rate of growth also increases. For example, bacteria often reproduce at an exponential rate when grown under ideal conditions. As each generation passes, there are more and more bacteria to reproduce. As a result, the growth rate of the bacterial population increases every generation ([Figure 15](#Figure_01_03_line)).

![Four line graphs are shown. All graphs have x-axis and y-axis scales from zero to ten in increments of two. Graph a is a linear relationship between x and y, where y equals m times x plus b, with a positive and a negative slope shown. Graph b is a quadratic relationship where y equals a times x squared plus b x plus c. The line curves upward. Graph c is a an inverse relationship where y equals a over x. The line curves downward. And graph d is an exponential relationship where y equals a to the power of x and the line curves upward, and where y equals a to the negative power of x and the line curves downward.__ALT__Figure_01_03_line](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_01_03_line.jpg)

### Using Logarithmic Scales in Graphing
Sometimes a variable can have a very large range of values. This presents a problem when you’re trying to figure out the best scale to use for your graph’s axes. One option is to use a . In a logarithmic scale, the value each mark labels is the previous mark’s value multiplied by some constant. For a log base 10 scale, each mark labels a value that is 10 times the value of the mark before it. Therefore, a base 10 logarithmic scale would be numbered: 0, 10, 100, 1,000, etc. You can see how the logarithmic scale covers a much larger range of values than the corresponding linear scale, in which the marks would label the values 0, 10, 20, 30, and so on.

If you use a logarithmic scale on one axis of the graph and a linear scale on the other axis, you are using a . The Richter scale, which measures the strength of earthquakes, uses a semi-log plot. The degree of ground movement is plotted on a logarithmic scale against the assigned intensity level of the earthquake, which ranges linearly from 1-10 ([Figure 16](#Figure_01_03_richter) **(a)**).

If a graph has both axes in a logarithmic scale, then it is referred to as a . The relationship between the wavelength and frequency of electromagnetic radiation such as light is usually shown as a log-log plot ([Figure 16](#Figure_01_03_richter) **(b)**). Log-log plots are also commonly used to describe exponential functions, such as radioactive decay.

![Two line graphs are shown. Graph a shows a graphical representation the Richter scale and uses a log base 10 scale on its y-axis in microns of amplified maximum ground motion. The x-axis has a scale from negative one through nine and indicates categories of earthquakes. Negative one to two is categorized as “Not felt.” Two to four is “Minor”, four to five is “Small”, five to six is “Moderate”, six to seven is “Strong”, seven to eight is “Major”, and above eight is “Great.” Graph b shows the relationship between the frequency and wavelength of electromagnetic radiation, plotted as a straight line using a log-log plot. The x-axis is labeled Wavelength in centimeters and has a scale from ten to the power of negative six through ten to the power of negative eight. The y-axis is labeled Frequency with units in s to the power of negative one. Using these units, the y-axis scale is from ten to the power of sixteen through ten to the power of nineteen. The plotted line shows an inverse relationship between frequency and wavelength.__ALT__Figure_01_03_richter](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_01_03_richter.jpg)
***Figure 16** (a) The Richter scale uses a log base 10 scale on its *y-axis* (microns of amplified maximum ground motion). (b) The relationship between the frequency and wavelength of electromagnetic radiation can be plotted as a straight line if a log-log plot is used.*

* Physical quantities are a characteristic or property of an object that can be measured or calculated from other measurements.
* The four fundamental units we will use in this textbook are the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), and the ampere (for electric current). These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature.

* Accuracy of a measured value refers to how close a measurement is to the correct value. The uncertainty in a measurement is an estimate of the amount by which the measurement result may differ from this value.
* Precision of measured values refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements.
* Significant figures express the precision of a measuring tool.
* When multiplying or dividing measured values, the final answer can contain only as many significant figures as the least precise value.
