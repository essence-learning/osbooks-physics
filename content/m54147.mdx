## Components of Vectors
For the  of vector addition and subtraction, we use some simple geometry and trigonometry, instead of using a ruler and protractor as we did for graphical methods. However, the graphical method will still come in handy to visualize the problem by drawing vectors using the head-to-tail method. The analytical method is more accurate than the graphical method, which is limited by the precision of the drawing. For a refresher on the definitions of the sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle, see [Figure 1](#Figure_05_02_trig).

![A right triangle is shown. The hypotenuse is labeled h, the vertical leg is labeled Y, and the horizontal leg is labeled X. The right angle is labeled with the angle symbol. The following formulas appear next to the triangle: sine angle equals y over h, cosine angle equals x over h, and tangent angle equals y over x.__ALT__Figure_05_02_trig](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_05_02_trig.jpg)
***Figure 1** For a right triangle, the sine, cosine, and tangent of *θ* are defined in terms of the adjacent side, the opposite side, or the hypotenuse. In this figure, *x* is the adjacent side, *y* is the opposite side, and *h* is the hypotenuse.*


Since, by definition,  , we can find the length *x* if we know *h* and    by using   . Similarly, we can find the length of *y* by using   . These trigonometric relationships are useful for adding vectors.

When a vector acts in more than one dimension, it is useful to break it down into its x and y components. For a two-dimensional vector, a  is a piece of a vector that points in either the x- or y-direction. Every 2-d vector can be expressed as a sum of its x and y components.

For example, given a vector like  in [Figure 2](#Figure_05_02_right), we may want to find what two perpendicular vectors,  and , add to produce it. In this example,  and  form a right triangle, meaning that the angle between them is 90 degrees. This is a common situation in physics and happens to be the least complicated situation trigonometrically.

![Vectors A, Ax, and Ay are shown. The vector A, with its tail at the origin of an x, y-coordinate system, is shown together with its x- and y-components, Ax and Ay. These vectors form a right triangle. The formula Ax plus Ay equals A is shown above the vectors.__ALT__Figure_05_02_right](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_05_02_right.jpg)
***Figure 2** The vector , with its tail at the origin of an *x*- *y*-coordinate system, is shown together with its *x*- and *y*-components,  and  These vectors form a right triangle.*

and  are defined to be the components of  along the *x*- and *y*-axes. The three vectors, , , and , form a right triangle.


If the vector  is known, then its magnitude  (its length) and its angle  (its direction) are known. To find  and , its *x*- and *y*-components, we use the following relationships for a right triangle:


and


where  is the magnitude of **A** in the *x*-direction,  is the magnitude of **A** in the *y*-direction, and  is the angle of the resultant with respect to the *x*-axis, as shown in [Figure 3](#Figure_05_02_angle).

![Vectors A x and A y form the legs of a right triangle and vector A forms the hypotenuse. Vector Ax is along an x-axis and vector Y is vertical and dashed. A x equals A times cosine angle. A y equals A times sine angle. A x plus A y equals A.__ALT__Figure_05_02_angle](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_05_02_angle.jpg)
***Figure 3** The magnitudes of the vector components  and  can be related to the resultant vector  and the angle  with trigonometric identities. Here we see that  and*


Suppose, for example, that  is the vector representing the total displacement of the person walking in a city, as illustrated in [Figure 4](#Figure_05_02_blocks).

![A map is shown over top x and y-axes. The origin is labeled Starting Point. The x-axis represents east and has a scale from zero to nine in increments of one. The y-axis represents north and has a scale from zero to five in increments of one. Lines show that a person walks nine blocks east and five blocks north. A displacement vector is plotted from the origin to the destination of nine, five on the axes. The following label is next to the y-axis: A y equals A times sine angle, equals ten point three blocks times sine twenty-nine point one, equals five blocks north. The following label is next to the x-axis: A x equals A cosine angle, equals ten point three blocks times sine twenty-nine point one, equals nine blocks east.__ALT__Figure_05_02_blocks](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_05_02_blocks.jpg)
***Figure 4** We can use the relationships    and    to determine the magnitude of the horizontal and vertical component vectors in this example.*

Then A = 10.3 blocks and  , so that


This magnitude indicates that the walker has traveled 9 blocks to the east—in other words, a 9-block eastward displacement. Similarly,


indicating that the walker has traveled 5 blocks to the north—a 5-block northward displacement.

## Analytical Method of Vector Addition and Subtraction
Calculating a resultant vector (or vector addition) is the reverse of breaking the resultant down into its components. If the perpendicular components    and    of a vector    are known, then we can find    analytically. How do we do this? Since, by definition,


we solve for    to find the direction of the resultant.


Note that  gives an angle in the first quadrant if 
       and in the fourth quadrant if 
      . If, in fact, both  and  are negative, or if  is negative and  positive, then , measured from the positive  direction, is 
      .

Since this is a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem (x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = h<sup>2</sup>) for finding the hypotenuse applies. In this case, it becomes


Solving for A gives


In summary, to find the magnitude    and direction    of a vector from its perpendicular components    and  , as illustrated in [Figure 5](#Figure_05_02_diagonal), we use the following relationships:


![Vectors Ax and Ay form the legs of a right triangle and vector A forms the hypotenuse. Vectors Ax and Ay are dashed. The formula angle equals inverse tangent times Ay over Ax is inside the triangle. Vector A is labeled A equals the square root of Ax squared plus Ay squared.__ALT__Figure_05_02_diagonal](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_05_02_diagonal.jpg)
***Figure 5** The magnitude and direction of the resultant vector  can be determined once the horizontal components  and  have been determined.*


Sometimes, the vectors added are not perfectly perpendicular to one another. An example of this is the case below, where the vectors    and    are added to produce the resultant    as illustrated in [Figure 6](#Figure_05_02_direction).

![A compass is shown on the left. On the right, vectors A, B, and R form a triangle, with the vertex of AR at the origin of an x-y axis. The formula A plus B equals R is above the triangle.__ALT__Figure_05_02_direction](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_05_02_direction.jpg)
***Figure 6** Vectors  and  are two legs of a walk, and  is the resultant or total displacement. You can use analytical methods to determine the magnitude and direction of  .*

If  and  represent two legs of a walk (two displacements), then  is the total displacement. The person taking the walk ends up at the tip of  . There are many ways to arrive at the same point. The person could have walked straight ahead first in the *x*-direction and then in the *y*-direction. Those paths are the *x*- and *y*-components of the resultant,  and  If we know  and , we can find  and  using the equations  and  .

* Draw in the *x* and *y* components of each vector (including the resultant) with a dashed line. Use the equations  and  to find the components. In [Figure 7](#Figure_05_02_dotted), these components are , , , and  Vector  makes an angle of  with the *x*-axis, and vector  makes and angle of  with its own *x*-axis (which is slightly above the *x*-axis used by vector **A**).
          ![A compass is shown on the left. On the right, vectors A, B, and R form a triangle, with the vertex of AR at the origin of an x-y axis. The formula A plus B equals R is above the triangle. Dashed lines indicate vertical and horizontal components of each vector. Labels indicate locations for angle A and angle B.__ALT__Figure_05_02_dotted](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_05_02_dotted.jpg)

* Find the *x* component of the resultant by adding the *x* component of the vectors
          and find the *y* component of the resultant (as illustrated in [Figure 8](#Figure_05_02_R)) by adding the *y* component of the vectors.

          ![A compass is shown on the left. On the right, vectors A, B, and R form a triangle, with the vertex of AR at the origin of an x-y axis. The formula A plus B equals R is above the triangle. Dashed lines indicate vertical and horizontal components of each vector. Labels indicate locations for angle A and angle B. The formula Rx equals Ax plus Bx is below the x-axis. The formula Ry equals Ay plus By is next to the y-axis.__ALT__Figure_05_02_R](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_05_02_R.jpg)

> Atmospheric science is a , meaning that it is a science based heavily on physics. Atmospheric science includes meteorology (the study of weather) and climatology (the study of climate). Climate is basically the average weather over a longer time scale. Weather changes quickly over time, whereas the climate changes more gradually.
> 
> The movement of air, water and heat is vitally important to climatology and meteorology. Since motion is such a major factor in weather and climate, this field uses vectors for much of its math.
> 
> Vectors are used to represent currents in the ocean, wind velocity and forces acting on a parcel of air. You have probably seen a weather map using vectors to show the strength (magnitude) and direction of the wind.
> 
> Vectors used in atmospheric science are often three-dimensional. We won’t cover three-dimensional motion in this text, but to go from two-dimensions to three-dimensions, you simply add a third vector component. Three-dimensional motion is represented as a combination of *x*-, *y*- and *z* components, where *z* is the altitude.
> 
> Vector calculus combines vector math with calculus, and is often used to find the rates of change in temperature, pressure or wind speed over time or distance. This is useful information, since atmospheric motion is driven by changes in pressure or temperature. The greater the variation in pressure over a given distance, the stronger the wind to try to correct that imbalance. Cold air tends to be more dense and therefore has higher pressure than warm air. Higher pressure air rushes into a region of lower pressure and gets deflected by the spinning of the Earth, and friction slows the wind at Earth’s surface.
> 
> Finding how wind changes over distance and multiplying vectors lets meteorologists, like the one shown in [Figure 9](#Figure_05_02_weather), figure out how much rotation (spin) there is in the atmosphere at any given time and location. This is an important tool for tornado prediction. Conditions with greater rotation are more likely to produce tornadoes.
