## Photon Momentum

Do photons abide by the fundamental properties of physics? Can packets of electromagnetic energy possibly follow the same rules as a ping-pong ball or an electron? Although strange to consider, the answer to both questions is yes.

Despite the odd nature of photons, scientists prior to Einstein had long suspected that the fundamental particle of electromagnetic radiation shared properties with our more macroscopic particles. This is no clearer than when considering the photoelectric effect, where photons knock electrons out of a substance. While it is strange to think of a massless particle exhibiting momentum, it is now a well-established fact within the scientific community. [Figure 1](#Figure_21_03_Comet) shows macroscopic evidence of .

![There are two images shown. The left image is a drawing of a comet’s path around the sun. The comet’s path is shown with a black line, while the comet is drawn in orange for nine successive moments in time. In each comet drawing, the tail of the comet is seen pointing away from the sun. The right image is a photograph of a comet. In the image, the comet is seen with two tails: one bright white and one a faint blue.__ALT__Figure_21_03_Comet](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_21_03_Comet.jpg)
***Figure 1** The tails of the Hale-Bopp comet point away from the Sun, evidence that light has momentum. Dust emanating from the body of the comet forms this tail. Particles of dust are pushed away from the Sun by light reflecting from them. The blue, ionized gas tail is also produced by photons interacting with atoms in the comet material.

[Figure 1](#Figure_21_03_Comet) shows a comet with two prominent tails. Comet tails are composed of gases and dust evaporated from the body of the comet and ionized gas. What most people do not know about the tails is that they always point *away*from the Sun rather than trailing behind the comet. This can be seen in the diagram.

Why would this be the case? The evidence indicates that the dust particles of the comet are forced away from the Sun when photons strike them. Evidently, photons carry momentum in the direction of their motion away from the Sun, and some of this momentum is transferred to dust particles in collisions. The blue tail is caused by the solar wind, a stream of plasma consisting primarily of protons and electrons evaporating from the corona of the Sun.

## Momentum, The Compton Effect, and Solar Sails
Momentum is conserved in quantum mechanics, just as it is in relativity and classical physics. Some of the earliest direct experimental evidence of this came from the scattering of X-ray photons by electrons in substances, a phenomenon discovered by American physicist Arthur H.  (1892–1962). Around 1923, Compton observed that X-rays reflecting from materials had decreased energy and correctly interpreted this as being due to the scattering of the X-ray photons by electrons. This phenomenon could be handled as a collision between two particles—a photon and an electron at rest in the material. After careful observation, it was found that both energy and momentum were conserved in the collision. See [Figure 2](#Figure_21_03_Compton). For the discovery of this conserved scattering, now known as the , Arthur Compton was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1929.

Shortly after the discovery of Compton scattering, the value of the photon momentum,

was determined by Louis de Broglie. In this equation, called the de Broglie relation, *h*represents Planck’s constant and *λ*is the photon wavelength.

![The image shows a collision between a photon of light and an electron. The photon of light is shown travelling downward and to the right toward a stationary electron, and then is shown rebounding upward and to the right after the drawn collision. The electron is shown stationary and the moving downward after the collision. Also in the image are the equations E = hf and E' = hf', which correspond to the energy of the photon before and after the collision. Near the electron is the equation KEe = E - E', showing the effect the collision has on the electron’s energy.__ALT__Figure_21_03_Compton](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_21_03_Compton.jpg)
***Figure 2** The Compton effect is the name given to the scattering of a photon by an electron. Energy and momentum are conserved, resulting in a reduction of both for the scattered photon.*


We can see that photon momentum is small, since    and *h*is very small. It is for this reason that we do not ordinarily observe photon momentum. Our mirrors do not recoil when light reflects from them, except perhaps in cartoons. Compton saw the effects of photon momentum because he was observing X-rays, which have a small wavelength and a relatively large momentum, interacting with the lightest of particles, the electron.

> > When determining energies in particle physics, it is more sensible to use the unit eV instead of Joules. Using eV will help you to recognize differences in magnitude more easily and will make calculations simpler. Also, eV is used by scientists to describe the binding energy of particles and their rest mass, so using eV will eliminate the need to convert energy quantities. Finally, eV is a convenient unit when linking electromagnetic forces to particle physics, as one eV is the amount energy given to an electron when placed in a field of 1-V potential difference.
## Practice Problems


![There are two images shown. The image on the left is a drawing of a solar sail, which looks like a large parachute carrying a payload (the spacecraft). The solar sail is moving to the left. Blue arrows show photons from the sun moving from the right and striking the solar sail. The image on the right is an overhead photo of the very large solar sail unfurled. There are four people shown at the bottom of the picture for scale. They are approximately one-sixth of the width of the sail.__ALT__Figure_21_03_Cosmos1](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_21_03_Cosmos1.jpg)
***Figure 3** (a) Space sails have been proposed that use the momentum of sunlight reflecting from gigantic low-mass sails to propel spacecraft about the solar system. A Russian test model of this (the Cosmos 1) was launched in 2005, but did not make it into orbit due to a rocket failure. (b) A U.S. version of this, labeled LightSail-1, is scheduled for trial launches in 2016. It will have a 40 m2 sail. (credit: Kim Newton/NASA)*

> Traversing the Solar System using nothing but the Sun’s power has long been a fantasy of scientists and science fiction writers alike. Though physicists like Compton, Einstein, and Planck all provided evidence of light’s propulsive capacity, it is only recently that the technology has become available to truly put these visions into motion. In 2016, by sending a lightweight satellite into space, the  project is designed to do just that.
> 
> A citizen-funded project headed by the Planetary Society, the 5.45-million-dollar LightSail-1 project is set to launch two crafts into orbit around the Earth. Each craft is equipped with a 32-square-meter solar sail prepared to unfurl once a rocket has launched it to an appropriate altitude. The sails are made of large mirrors, each a quarter of the thickness of a trash bag, which will receive an impulse from the Sun’s reflecting photons. Each time the Sun’s photon strikes the craft’s reflective surface and bounces off, it will provide a momentum to the sail much greater than if the photon were simply absorbed.
> 
> Attached to three tiny satellites called CubeSats, whose combined volume is no larger than a loaf of bread, the received momentum from the Sun’s photons should be enough to record a substantial increase in orbital speed. The intent of the LightSail-1 mission is to prove that the technology behind photon momentum travel is sound and can be done cheaply. A test flight in May 2015 showed that the craft’s Mylar sails could unfurl on command. With another successful result in 2016, the Planetary Society will be planning future versions of the craft with the hopes of eventually achieving interplanetary satellite travel. Though a few centuries premature, Kepler’s fantastic vision may not be that far away.

## Particle-Wave Duality

We have long known that EM radiation is like a wave, capable of interference and diffraction. We now see that light can also be modeled as particles—massless photons of discrete energy and momentum. We call this twofold nature the , meaning that EM radiation has properties of both particles and waves. This may seem contradictory, since we ordinarily deal with large objects that never act like both waves and particles. An ocean wave, for example, looks nothing like a grain of sand. However, this so-called duality is simply a term for properties of the photon analogous to phenomena we can observe directly, on a macroscopic scale. See [Figure 5](#Figure_21_03_Properties). If this term seems strange, it is because we do not ordinarily observe details on the quantum level directly, and our observations yield either particle-like *or*wave-like properties, but never both simultaneously.

![There are two drawings shown. On the left is a drawing of light striking a barrier with two slits. As the light passes through the slits, it creates an interference pattern. The interference pattern projects onto a screen, where the terms max and min are used to show the locations of constructive and destructive wave interference. On the right is an enlarged drawing of a grain of sand. There is an arrow pointing to the grain of sand, with a picture of a photon at the other end of the arrow.__ALT__Figure_21_03_Properties](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_21_03_Properties.jpg)
***Figure 5** (a) The interference pattern for light through a double slit is a wave property understood by analogy to water waves. (b) The properties of photons having quantized energy and momentum and acting as a concentrated unit are understood by analogy to macroscopic particles.*

Since we have a particle-wave duality for photons, and since we have seen connections between photons and matter in that both have momentum, it is reasonable to ask whether there is a particle-wave duality for matter as well. If the EM radiation we once thought to be a pure wave has particle properties, is it possible that matter has wave properties? The answer, strangely, is yes. The consequences of this are tremendous, as particle-wave duality has been a constant source of scientific wonder during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.
