## Relativistic Effects on Time, Distance, and Momentum
Consideration of the measurement of elapsed time and simultaneity leads to an important relativistic effect.  is the phenomenon of time passing more slowly for an observer who is moving relative to another observer.

For example, suppose an astronaut measures the time it takes for light to travel from the light source, cross her ship, bounce off a mirror, and return. (See [Figure 1](#Figure_10_02_astronaut).) How does the elapsed time the astronaut measures compare with the elapsed time measured for the same event by a person on the earth? Asking this question (another thought experiment) produces a profound result. We find that the elapsed time for a process depends on who is measuring it. In this case, the time measured by the astronaut is smaller than the time measured by the earth bound observer. The passage of time is different for the two observers because the distance the light travels in the astronaut’s frame is smaller than in the earth bound frame. Light travels at the same speed in each frame, and so it will take longer to travel the greater distance in the earth bound frame.

When this happens, time measurements are the same in both frames of reference.  effects, meaning those that have to do with special relativity, usually become significant when speeds become comparable to the speed of light. This is seen to be the case for time dilation.

You may have seen science fiction movies in which space travelers return to Earth after a long trip to find that the planet and everyone on it has aged much more than they have. This type of scenario is a based on a thought experiment, known as the , which imagines a pair of twins, one of whom goes on a trip into space while the other stays home. When the space traveler returns, she finds her twin has aged much more than she. This happens because the traveling twin has been in two , one leaving Earth and one returning.

Time dilation has been confirmed by comparing the time recorded by an atomic clock sent into orbit to the time recorded by a clock that remained on Earth. GPS satellites must also be adjusted to compensate for time dilation in order to give accurate positioning.

Have you ever driven on a road, like that shown in [Figure 2](#Figure_10_02_road), that seems like it goes on forever? If you look ahead, you might say you have about 10 km left to go. Another traveler might say the road ahead looks like it is about 15 km long. If you both measured the road, however, you would agree. Traveling at everyday speeds, the distance you both measure would be the same. You will read in this section, however, that this is not true at relativistic speeds. Close to the speed of light, distances measured are not the same when measured by different observers moving with respect to one other.

One thing all observers agree upon is their . When one observer is traveling away from another, they both see the other receding at the same speed, regardless of whose frame of reference is chosen. Remember that speed equals distance divided by time: *v = d/t*. If the observers experience a difference in elapsed time, they must also observe a difference in distance traversed. This is because the ratio *d/t* must be the same for both observers.

The shortening of distance experienced by an observer moving with respect to the points whose distance apart is measured is called . , *L*, is the distance between two points measured in the reference frame where the observer and the points are at rest. The observer in motion with respect to the points measures *L*. These two lengths are related by the equation

In classical physics, momentum is a simple product of mass and velocity. When special relativity is taken into account, objects that have mass have a speed limit. What effect do you think mass and velocity have on the momentum of objects moving at relativistic speeds; i.e., speeds close to the speed of light?

is one of the most important concepts in physics. The broadest form of Newton’s second law is stated in terms of momentum. Momentum is conserved in classical mechanics whenever the net external force on a system is zero. This makes momentum conservation a fundamental tool for analyzing collisions. We will see that momentum has the same importance in modern physics.  is conserved, and much of what we know about subatomic structure comes from the analysis of collisions of accelerator-produced relativistic particles.

One of the postulates of special relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. Does the law of conservation of momentum survive this requirement at high velocities? The answer is yes, provided that the momentum is defined as follows.

Relativistic momentum, **p**, is classical momentum multiplied by the relativistic factor <math>        <mrow>          <mi>γ</mi><mtext>.</mtext>        </mrow>      </math>

This is another indication that an object with mass cannot reach the speed of light. If it did, its momentum would become infinite, which is an unreasonable value.

Relativistic momentum is defined in such a way that the conservation of momentum will hold in all inertial frames. Whenever the net external force on a system is zero, relativistic momentum is conserved, just as is the case for classical momentum. This has been verified in numerous experiments.

## Mass-Energy Equivalence
Let us summarize the calculation of relativistic effects on objects moving at speeds near the speed of light. In each case we will need to calculate the relativistic factor, given by

where **v** and  *c* are as defined earlier. We use **u** as the velocity of a particle or an object in one frame of reference, and **v** for the velocity of one frame of reference with respect to another.

### Relativistic Energy
The original source of all the energy we use is the conversion of mass into energy. Most of this energy is generated by nuclear reactions in the sun and radiated to Earth in the form of electromagnetic radiation, where it is then transformed into all the forms with which we are familiar. The remaining energy from nuclear reactions is produced in nuclear power plants and in Earth’s interior. In each of these cases, the source of the energy is the conversion of a small amount of mass into a large amount of energy. These sources are shown in [Figure 4](#Figure_10_02_energy).

![A picture of the sun (a) and a power plant (b)__ALT__Figure_10_02_energy](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_10_02_energy.jpg)

The first postulate of relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. Einstein showed that the law of conservation of energy is valid relativistically, if we define energy to include a relativistic factor. The result of his analysis is that a particle or object of mass *m* moving at velocity **u** has  given by

<equation id="fs-id1164354626061" class="unnumbered">      <label /> <math display="block">      <mrow>        <mi>E</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>γ</mi><mi>m</mi><msup>          <mi>c</mi>          <mn>2</mn>        </msup>        <mo>.</mo>      </mrow>    </math>    </equation>

Then the rest energy, *E*, is simply

<equation id="fs-id1164354626824" class="unnumbered"><label /> <math display="block">      <mrow>        <msub>          <mi>E</mi>          <mn>0</mn>        </msub>        <mo>=</mo><mi>m</mi><msup>          <mi>c</mi>          <mn>2</mn>        </msup>        <mo>.</mo>      </mrow>    </math>    </equation>    
This is the correct form of Einstein’s famous equation.

This equation is very useful to nuclear physicists because it can be used to calculate the energy released by a nuclear reaction. This is done simply by subtracting the mass of the products of such a reaction from the mass of the reactants. The difference is the *m* in <math>      <mrow>        <msub>          <mi>E</mi>          <mn>0</mn>        </msub>        <mo>=</mo><mi>m</mi><msup>          <mi>c</mi>          <mn>2</mn>        </msup>        <mtext>.</mtext>      </mrow>    </math>  Here is a simple example:  Here is a simple example:

Because both particles have a rest mass of 9.11 × 10<sup>–31</sup> kg, we multiply the *mc*<sup>2</sup> term by 2. So the energy of the gamma rays is

where we have the expression for the joule (J) in terms of its SI base units of kg, m, and s. In general, the nuclei of stable isotopes have less mass then their constituent subatomic particles. The energy equivalent of this difference is called the  of the nucleus. This energy is released during the formation of the isotope from its constituent particles because the product is more stable than the reactants. Expressed as mass, it is called the . For example, a helium nucleus is made of two neutrons and two protons and has a mass of 4.0003 atomic mass units (u). The sum of the masses of two protons and two neutrons is 4.0330 u. The mass defect then is 0.0327 u. Converted to kg, the mass defect is 5.0442 × 10<sup>–30</sup> kg. Multiplying this mass times *c*<sup>2</sup> gives a binding energy of 4.540 × 10<sup>–12</sup> J. This does not sound like much because it is only one atom. If you were to make one gram of helium out of neutrons and protons, it would release 683,000,000,000 J. By comparison, burning one gram of coal releases about 24 J.


> ### The RHIC Collider
> [Figure 5](#Figure_10_02_lab) shows the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, NY. The circular structure houses a particle accelerator called the RHIC, which stands for Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The heavy ions in the name are gold nuclei that have been stripped of their electrons. Streams of ions are accelerated in several stages before entering the big ring seen in the figure. Here, they are accelerated to their final speed, which is about 99.7 percent the speed of light. Such high speeds are called relativistic. All the relativistic phenomena we have been discussing in this chapter are very pronounced in this case. At this speed <math>        <mrow>          <mi>γ</mi>        </mrow>      </math> = 12.9, so that relativistic time dilates by a factor of about 13, and relativistic length contracts by the same factor. = 12.9, so that relativistic time dilates by a factor of about 13, and relativistic length contracts by the same factor.

> Two ion beams circle the 2.4-mile long track around the big ring in opposite directions. The paths can then be made to cross, thereby causing ions to collide. The collision event is very short-lived but amazingly intense. The temperatures and pressures produced are greater than those in the hottest suns. At 4 trillion degrees Celsius, this is the hottest material ever created in a laboratory
> 
> But what is the point of creating such an extreme event? Under these conditions, the neutrons and protons that make up the gold nuclei are smashed apart into their components, which are called quarks and gluons. The goal is to recreate the conditions that theorists believe existed at the very beginning of the universe. It is thought that, at that time, matter was a sort of soup of quarks and gluons. When things cooled down after the initial bang, these particles condensed to form protons and neutrons.
> 
> Some of the results have been surprising and unexpected. It was thought the quark-gluon soup would resemble a gas or plasma. Instead, it behaves more like a liquid. It has been called a *perfect* liquid because it has virtually no viscosity, meaning that it has no resistance to flow.

## Section Summary
* Time dilates, length contracts, and momentum increases as an object approaches the speed of light.
* Energy and mass are interchangeable, according to the relationship *E = mc*2. The laws of conservation of mass and energy are combined into the law of conservation of mass-energy.
