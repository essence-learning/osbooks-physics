## Static Friction and Kinetic Friction
Recall from the previous chapter that friction is a force that opposes relative motion parallel to the contact surface of the interacting objects and is around us all the time. Friction allows us to move, which you have discovered if you have ever tried to walk on ice.

There are different types of friction—kinetic and static.  acts on an object in relative motion, while  acts on an object or system at rest relative to each other. The maximum static friction is usually greater than the kinetic friction between the objects.


Imagine, for example, trying to slide a heavy crate across a concrete floor. You may push harder and harder on the crate and not move it at all. This means that the static friction responds to what you do—it increases to be equal to and in the opposite direction of your push. But if you finally push hard enough, the crate seems to slip suddenly and starts to move. Once in motion, it is easier to keep it in motion than it was to get it started because the kinetic friction force is less than the static friction force. If you were to add mass to the crate, (for example, by placing a box on top of it) you would need to push even harder to get it started and also to keep it moving. If, on the other hand, you oiled the concrete you would find it easier to get the crate started and keep it going.

[Figure 1](#Figure_05_04_surface) shows how friction occurs at the interface between two objects. Magnifying these surfaces shows that they are rough on the microscopic level. So when you push to get an object moving (in this case, a crate), you must raise the object until it can skip along with just the tips of the surface hitting, break off the points, or do both. The harder the surfaces are pushed together (such as if another box is placed on the crate), the more force is needed to move them.

***Figure 1** Frictional forces, such as **f**, always oppose motion or attempted motion between objects in contact. Friction arises in part because of the roughness of the surfaces in contact, as seen in the expanded view.*

The magnitude of the frictional force has two forms: one for static friction, the other for kinetic friction. When there is no motion between the objects, the magnitude of static friction **f** is


where  is the coefficient of static friction and **N** is the magnitude of the normal force. Recall that the normal force acts perpendicular to the surface and prevents the crate from falling through the floor. It opposes the force of gravity in this example, but that will not always be the case.

Since the symbol  means less than or equal to, this equation says that static friction can have a maximum value of  That is,


Static friction is a responsive force that increases to be equal and opposite to whatever force is exerted, up to its maximum limit. Once the applied force exceeds **f**s(max), the object will move. Once an object is moving, the magnitude of kinetic friction **f** is given by


where    is the coefficient of kinetic friction.

Friction varies from surface to surface because different substances are rougher than others. [Figure __REPLACE_Table_05_02__](#Table_05_02) compares values of static and kinetic friction for different surfaces. The coefficient of the friction depends on the two surfaces that are in contact.

Since friction always opposes relative motion, the direction of friction is upward along the plane if the object is at rest or sliding down the incline. For example, if the crate you try to push (with a force parallel to the floor) has a mass of 100 kg, then the normal force would be equal to its weight


perpendicular to the floor. If the coefficient of static friction is 0.45, you would have to exert a force parallel to the floor greater than


to move the crate. Once there is motion, friction is less and the coefficient of kinetic friction might be 0.30, so that a force of only 290 N


would keep it moving at a constant speed. If the floor were lubricated, both coefficients would be much smaller than they would be without lubrication. The coefficient of friction is unitless and is a number usually between 0 and 1.0, but there is no theoretical upper limit to its value.

## Working with Inclined Planes
We discussed previously that when an object rests on a horizontal surface, there is a normal force supporting it equal in magnitude to its weight. Up until now, we dealt only with normal force in one dimension, with gravity and normal force acting perpendicular to the surface in opposing directions (gravity downward, and normal force upward). Now that you have the skills to work with forces in two dimensions, we can explore what happens to weight and the normal force on a tilted surface such as an inclined plane. For inclined plane problems, it is easier breaking down the forces into their components if we rotate the coordinate system, as illustrated in [Figure 2](#Figure_05_04_weight). The first step when setting up the problem is to break down the force of weight into components.

![A diagram shows perpendicular and horizontal components of weight. The weight is on an inclined plane that slopes downward to the right.__ALT__Figure_05_04_weight](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_05_04_weight.jpg)
***Figure 2** The diagram shows perpendicular and horizontal components of weight on an inclined plane.*


When an object rests on an incline that makes an angle  with the horizontal, the force of gravity acting on the object is divided into two components: A force acting perpendicular to the plane, , and a force acting parallel to the plane,  . The perpendicular force of weight, , is typically equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the normal force,  The force acting parallel to the plane, , causes the object to accelerate down the incline. The force of friction, , opposes the motion of the object, so it acts upward along the plane.

It is important to be careful when resolving the weight of the object into components. If the angle of the incline is at an angle  to the horizontal, then the magnitudes of the weight components are



Instead of memorizing these equations, it is helpful to be able to determine them from reason. To do this, draw the right triangle formed by the three weight vectors. Notice that the angle   of the incline is the same as the angle formed between  and  . Knowing this property, you can use trigonometry to determine the magnitude of the weight components

> 
> Normal force is represented by the variable  This should not be confused with the symbol for the newton, which is also represented by the letter N. It is important to tell apart these symbols, especially since the units for normal force (  ) happen to be newtons (N). For example, the normal force, , that the floor exerts on a chair might be  One important difference is that normal force is a vector, while the newton is simply a unit. Be careful not to confuse these letters in your calculations!
To review, the process for solving inclined plane problems is as follows:

* Draw a sketch of the problem.
* Identify known and unknown quantities, and identify the system of interest.
* Draw a free-body diagram (which is a sketch showing all of the forces acting on an object) with the coordinate system rotated at the same angle as the inclined plane. Resolve the vectors into horizontal and vertical components and draw them on the free-body diagram.
* Write Newton’s second law in the horizontal and vertical directions and add the forces acting on the object. If the object does not accelerate in a particular direction (for example, the *x* -direction) then **F**net *x* = 0. If the object does accelerate in that direction, **F**net *x* = *m***a**.
* Check your answer. Is the answer reasonable? Are the units correct?

> An object will slide down an inclined plane at a constant velocity if the net force on the object is zero. We can use this fact to measure the coefficient of kinetic friction between two objects.

These forces act in opposite directions, so when they have equal magnitude, the acceleration is zero. Writing these out

## Section Summary
* Friction is a contact force between systems that opposes the motion or attempted motion between them. Simple friction is proportional to the normal force **N** pushing the systems together. A normal force is always perpendicular to the contact surface between systems. Friction depends on both of the materials involved.
* µ is the coefficient of static friction, which depends on both of the materials.
* µ is the coefficient of kinetic friction, which also depends on both materials.
* When objects rest on an inclined plane that makes an angle  with the horizontal surface, the weight of the object can be broken into components that act perpendicular  
 and parallel (  ) to the surface of the plane.
