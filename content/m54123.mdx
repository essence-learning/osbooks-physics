## Defining Acceleration
Throughout this chapter we will use the following terms: *time*, *displacement*, *velocity*, and *acceleration*. Recall that each of these terms has a designated variable and SI unit of measurement as follows:

* : *t*, measured in seconds (s)
* : Δ*d*, measured in meters (m)
* : *v*, measured in meters per second (m/s)
* : *a*, measured in meters per second per second (m/s<sup>2</sup>, also called meters per second squared)
* Also note the following:
* Δ means *change in*
* The subscript 0 refers to an initial value; sometimes subscript i is instead used to refer to initial value.
* The subscript f refers to final value
* A bar over a symbol, such as  <math><mover accent="true"><mi>a</mi><mo>¯</mo></mover></math>, means , means *average*

Acceleration is the change in velocity divided by a period of time during which the change occurs. The SI units of velocity are m/s and the SI units for time are s, so the SI units for acceleration are m/s<sup>2</sup>.  is given by

Average acceleration is distinguished from , which is acceleration at a specific instant in time. The magnitude of acceleration is often not constant over time. For example, runners in a race accelerate at a greater rate in the first second of a race than during the following seconds. You do not need to know all the instantaneous accelerations at all times to calculate average acceleration. All you need to know is the change in velocity (i.e., the final velocity minus the initial velocity) and the change in time (i.e., the final time minus the initial time), as shown in the formula. A component of the average acceleration can be positive, negative, or zero. A  component is simply an acceleration in the negative direction along that axis. When the motion is in one dimension, we often simply refer to this as negative acceleration, and acceleration in the positive direction as positive acceleration.

Keep in mind that although acceleration points in the same direction as the *change* in velocity, it is not always in the direction of the velocity itself. When an object slows down, its acceleration is opposite to the direction of its velocity. In everyday language, this is called deceleration; but in physics, it is acceleration—whose direction happens to be opposite that of the velocity. For now, let us assume that motion to the right along the *x*-axis is *positive* and motion to the left is *negative*.

[Figure 1](#Figure_03_01_Car) shows a car with positive acceleration in (a) and negative acceleration in (b). The arrows represent vectors showing both direction and magnitude of velocity and acceleration.

![Two similar cars are shown. The first car is speeding up as indicated by a velocity vector and an acceleration vector pointing to the right. The second car is slowing down as indicated by a velocity vector pointing to the right and an acceleration vector pointing to the left. Unlabeled x and y-axes are shown for reference.__ALT__Figure_03_01_Car](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_03_01_car.jpg)
***Figure 1** The car is speeding up in (a) and slowing down in (b).*

Velocity and acceleration are both . Recall that vectors have both magnitude and direction. An object traveling at a constant speed does accelerate if it changes direction. So, turning the steering wheel of a moving car makes the car accelerate because the velocity changes direction.

> ### The Moving Man
> With this animation, you can produce both variations of acceleration and velocity shown in [Figure 1](#Figure_03_01_Car), plus a few more variations. Vary the velocity and acceleration by sliding the red and green markers along the scales. Keeping the velocity marker near zero will make the effect of acceleration more obvious. Try changing acceleration from positive to negative while the man is moving. We will come back to this animation and look at the *Charts* view when we study graphical representation of motion.

## Calculating Average Acceleration
Look back at the equation for average acceleration. You can see that the calculation of average acceleration involves three values: change in time, (Δ*t*); change in velocity, (Δ*v*); and acceleration (*a*).

Change in  is often stated as a time interval, and change in velocity can often be calculated by subtracting the initial velocity from the final velocity. Average acceleration is then simply change in velocity divided by change in time. Before you begin calculating, be sure that all distances and times have been converted to meters and seconds. Look at these examples of acceleration of a subway train.

Recall that for analysis of motion in only one dimension, we do not need to use vectors. Instead, we can treat displacement, velocity, and acceleration as scalars. Unlike magnitudes, scalars can be positive or negative, so the sign can serve to tell us the direction along the one-dimensional axis.
