More than 100 years before Thomson and Rutherford discovered the fundamental particles that carry positive and negative electric charges, the French scientist Charles-Augustin de  mathematically described the force between charged objects. Doing so required careful measurements of forces between charged spheres, for which he built an ingenious device called a .

This device, shown in [Figure 1](#Figure_18_02_torsionbal), contains an insulating rod that is hanging by a thread inside a glass-walled enclosure. At one end of the rod is the metallic sphere A. When no charge is on this sphere, it touches sphere B. Coulomb would touch the spheres with a third metallic ball (shown at the bottom of the diagram) that was charged. An unknown amount of charge would distribute evenly between spheres A and B, which would then repel each other, because like charges repel. This force would cause sphere A to rotate away from sphere B, thus twisting the wire until the torsion in the wire balanced the electrical force. Coulomb then turned the knob at the top, which allowed him to rotate the thread, thus bringing sphere A closer to sphere B. He found that bringing sphere A twice as close to sphere B required increasing the torsion by a factor of four. Bringing the sphere three times closer required a ninefold increase in the torsion. From this type of measurement, he deduced that the electrical force between the spheres was inversely proportional to the distance squared between the spheres. In other words,


where *r* is the distance between the spheres.

An  distributes itself equally between two conducting spheres of the same size. Knowing this allowed Coulomb to divide an unknown charge in half. Repeating this process would produce a sphere with one quarter of the initial charge, and so on. Using this technique, he measured the force between spheres A and B when they were charged with different amounts of charge. These measurements led him to deduce that the force was proportional to the charge on each sphere, or


where    is the charge on sphere A, and    is the charge on sphere B.

![This figure consists of seven drawings, the largest of which is labeled “Fig. 1”. The largest structure appears as follows: there is a cap at the top, and below that are a disc, a long cylinder, a wider disc, and a shorter cylinder. The six smaller drawings show the parts from which the large structure is assembled. One part, labeled “Fig. 5” and placed nearest the upper left corner, consists of a vertical rod with a hook at the top, a sphere at the bottom, and a disc over a hemisphere near the middle. Another part, labeled “Fig. 4”, lies parallel to the bottom edge of the figure. It consists of a rod with a short line and a small sphere attached to one end. Three parts, labeled “Fig. 2”, are arranged in a column on the right side of the figure. Of these, the upper part consists of a cap-shaped structure with a horizontal projection and a vertical projection; the middle part consists of a cylinder with a wider discover it; and the lower part consists of another cylinder with a lip. The final part, labeled “Fig. 3” and placed near the bottom right corner of the figure, is a T-shaped structure with a small sphere at each end of the horizontal line.__ALT__Figure_18_02_torsionbal](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_18_02_torsionbal.jpg)

Combining these two proportionalities, he proposed the following expression to describe the force between the charged spheres.


This equation is known as , and it describes the electrostatic force between charged objects. The constant of proportionality *k* is called . In SI units, the constant *k* has the value

The direction of the force is along the line joining the centers of the two objects. If the two charges are of opposite signs, Coulomb’s law gives a negative result. This means that the force between the particles is attractive. If the two charges have the same signs, Coulomb’s law gives a positive result. This means that the force between the particles is repulsive. For example, if both    and    are negative or if both are positive, the force between them is repulsive. This is shown in [Figure 2](#Figure_18_02_Coulomblaw)(a). If    is a negative charge and    is a positive charge (or vice versa), then the charges are different, so the force between them is attractive. This is shown in [Figure 2](#Figure_18_02_Coulomblaw)(b).

![This figure has two parts. Part a shows two small spheres of equal size, labeled “q subscript 1” and “q subscript 2”, separated by a distance marked as “r”. Each sphere contains a minus sign. Two arrows, labeled “F subscript 1,2” and “F subscript 2,1”, point from the spheres away from each other. Part b also shows two small spheres of equal size, labeled “q subscript 1” and “q subscript 2”, separated by a larger distance marked as “r”. One of these spheres contains a minus sign and the other contains a plus sign. Two arrows, labeled 7F subscript 1,2” and “F subscript 2,1”, point from the spheres toward each other.__ALT__Figure_18_02_Coulomblaw](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_18_02_Coulomblaw.jpg)
***Figure 2** The magnitude of the electrostatic force *F* between point charges *q* and *q* separated by a distance *r* is given by Coulomb’s law. Note that Newton’s third law (every force exerted creates an equal and opposite force) applies as usual—the force (*F*,) on *q* is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force (*F*,) it exerts on *q*. (a) Like charges. (b) Unlike charges.*


Note that Coulomb’s law applies only to charged objects that are not moving with respect to each other. The law says that the force is proportional to the amount of charge on each object and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. If we double the charge  , for instance, then the force is doubled. If we double the distance between the objects, then the force between them *decreases* by a factor of   . Although Coulomb’s law is true in general, it is easiest to apply to spherical objects or to objects that are much smaller than the distance between the objects (in which case, the objects can be approximated as spheres).

Coulomb’s law is an example of an , which means the force depends on the square of the denominator. Another inverse-square law is Newton’s law of universal gravitation, which is   . Although these laws are similar, they differ in two important respects: (i) The gravitational constant *G* is much, much smaller than *k*
 (  ); and (ii) only one type of mass exists, whereas two types of electric charge exist. These two differences explain why gravity is so much weaker than the electrostatic force and why gravity is only attractive, whereas the electrostatic force can be attractive or repulsive.

Finally, note that Coulomb measured the distance between the spheres from the centers of each sphere. He did not explain this assumption in his original papers, but it turns out to be valid. From *outside* a uniform spherical distribution of charge, it can be treated as if all the charge were located at the center of the sphere.
