## Speed
There is more to  than distance and displacement. Questions such as, “How long does a foot race take?” and “What was the runner’s speed?” cannot be answered without an understanding of other concepts. In this section we will look at , speed, and velocity to expand our understanding of motion.

A description of how fast or slow an object moves is its speed.  is the  at which an object changes its location. Like distance, speed is a  because it has a magnitude but not a direction. Because speed is a rate, it depends on the time interval of motion. You can calculate the elapsed time or the change in time,  , of motion as the difference between the ending time and the beginning time


The SI unit of time is the second (s), and the SI unit of speed is meters per second (m/s), but sometimes kilometers per hour (km/h), miles per hour (mph) or other units of speed are used.

When you describe an object's speed, you often describe the average over a time period. , *v*, is the distance traveled divided by the time during which the motion occurs.


You can, of course, rearrange the equation to solve for either distance or time



Suppose, for example, a car travels 150 kilometers in 3.2 hours. Its average speed for the trip is


A car's speed would likely increase and decrease many times over a 3.2 hour trip. Its speed at a specific instant in time, however, is its . A car's speedometer describes its instantaneous speed.


![A drawing is shown of a house on the left and a store on the right. The distance between the two is labeled three kilometers. A double-arrow vector between the house and the store is labeled with the equation change in d total equals zero.__ALT__Figure_02_02_Diagram](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_02_02_diagram.jpg)
***Figure 1** During a 30-minute round trip to the store, the total distance traveled is 6 km. The average speed is 12 km/h. The displacement for the round trip is zero, because there was no net change in position.*

### Velocity
The  version of speed is velocity.  describes the speed and direction of an object. As with speed, it is useful to describe either the average velocity over a time period or the velocity at a specific moment.  is displacement divided by the time over which the displacement occurs.


Velocity, like speed, has SI units of meters per second (m/s), but because it is a vector, you must also include a direction. Furthermore, the variable **v** for velocity is bold because it is a vector, which is in contrast to the variable *v* for speed which is italicized because it is a scalar quantity.

> It is important to keep in mind that the average speed is not the same thing as the average velocity without its direction. Like we saw with displacement and distance in the last section, changes in direction over a time interval have a bigger effect on speed and velocity.
Suppose a passenger moved toward the back of a plane with an average velocity of –4 m/s. We cannot tell from the average velocity whether the passenger stopped momentarily or backed up before he got to the back of the plane. To get more details, we must consider smaller segments of the trip over smaller time intervals such as those shown in [Figure 2](#Figure_02_02_plane). If you consider infinitesimally small intervals, you can define , which is the velocity at a specific instant in time. Instantaneous velocity and average velocity are the same if the velocity is constant.

![A drawing of an airplane facing to the right is shown, and is set in quadrant one of a coordinate plane. The x-axis is labeled df and then do. The distance between df and do is labeled with a left-pointing vector, change in d total. Four other vectors are shown below the airplane. Vector change in d a points to the left and is short. Vector change in d b points to the left and is also short. Vector change in d c points to the right and is short. Vector change in d d points to the left and is longer.__ALT__Figure_02_02_plane](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_02_02_plane.jpg)
***Figure 2** The diagram shows a more detailed record of an airplane passenger heading toward the back of the plane, showing smaller segments of his trip.*

Earlier, you have read that distance traveled can be different than the magnitude of displacement. In the same way, speed can be different than the magnitude of velocity. For example, you drive to a store and return home in half an hour. If your car’s odometer shows the total distance traveled was 6 km, then your average speed was 12 km/h. Your average velocity, however, was zero because your displacement for the round trip is zero.

## Practice Problems


> ### The Walking Man
> In this simulation you will put your cursor on the man and move him first in one direction and then in the opposite direction. Keep the *Introduction* tab active. You can use the *Charts* tab after you learn about graphing motion later in this chapter. Carefully watch the sign of the numbers in the position and velocity boxes. Ignore the acceleration box for now. See if you can make the man’s position positive while the velocity is negative. Then see if you can do the opposite.

## Check Your Understanding




## Section Summary
* Average speed is a scalar quantity that describes distance traveled divided by the time during which the motion occurs.
* Velocity is a vector quantity that describes the speed and direction of an object.
* Average velocity is displacement over the time period during which the displacement occurs. If the velocity is constant, then average velocity and instantaneous velocity are the same.
