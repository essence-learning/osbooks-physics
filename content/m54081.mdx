## About OpenStax
OpenStax is a nonprofit based at Rice University, and it’s our mission to improve student access to education. Our first openly licensed college textbook was published in 2012 and our library has since scaled to over 25 books for college and AP courses used by hundreds of thousands of students. OpenStax Tutor, our low-cost personalized learning tool, is being used in college courses throughout the country. Through our partnerships with philanthropic foundations and our alliance with other educational resource organizations, OpenStax is breaking down the most common barriers to learning and empowering students and instructors to succeed.

## About *Physics*
This instructional material was initially created through a Texas Education Agency (TEA) initiative to provide high-quality open-source instructional materials to districts free of charge. Funds were allocated by the 84th Texas Legislature (2015) for the creation of state-developed, open-source instructional materials with the request that advanced secondary courses supporting the study of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics should be prioritized.

*Physics* covers the scope and sequence requirements of a typical one-year physics course. The text provides comprehensive coverage of physical concepts, quantitative examples and skills, and interesting applications. High School Physics has been designed to meet and exceed the requirements of the relevant ), while allowing significant flexibility for instructors.

Qualified and experienced Texas faculty were involved throughout the development process, and the textbooks were reviewed extensively to ensure effectiveness and usability in each course. Reviewers considered each resource’s clarity, accuracy, student support, assessment rigor and appropriateness, alignment to TEKS, and overall quality. Their invaluable suggestions provided the basis for continually improved material and helped to certify that the books are ready for use. The writers and reviewers also considered common course issues, effective teaching strategies, and student engagement to provide instructors and students with useful, supportive content and drive effective learning experiences.

### Coverage and scope
*Physics* presents physical laws, research, concepts, and skills in a logical and engaging progression that should be familiar to most physics faculty. The textbook begins with a general introduction to physics and scientific processes, which is followed by several chapters on motion and Newton’s laws. After mechanics, the students will move through thermodynamics, waves and sound, and light and optics. Electricity and magnetism and nuclear physics complete the textbook.

### Flexibility
Like any OpenStax content, this textbook can be modified as needed for use by the instructor depending on the needs of the students in the course. Each set of materials created by OpenStax is organized into units and chapters and can be used like a traditional textbook as the entire syllabus for each course. The materials can also be accessed in smaller chunks for more focused use with a single student or an entire class. Instructors are welcome to download and assign the PDF version of the textbook through a learning management system or can use their LMS to link students to specific chapters and sections of the book relevant to the concept being studied. The entire textbook will be available during the fall of 2020 in an editable Google document, and until then instructors are welcome to copy and paste content from the textbook to modify as needed prior to instruction.

### Student-centered focus
*Physics* uses a friendly voice and exciting examples that appeal to a high school audience. The Chapter Openers, for example, include thought-provoking photographs and introductions that connect the content to experiences relevant to student’s lives. The writing in our program has been developed with universal design in mind to ensure students of all different backgrounds are reached. Content can be accessed through engaging text, informative visuals, hands-on activities, and online simulations. This diversity of learning media presents a wealth of reinforcement opportunities that allow students to review material in a new and fresh way.
