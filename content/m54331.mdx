## Properties of Sound Waves
is a wave. More specifically, sound is defined to be a disturbance of matter that is transmitted from its source outward. A disturbance is anything that is moved from its state of equilibrium. Some sound waves can be characterized as periodic waves, which means that the atoms that make up the matter experience simple .

A vibrating string produces a sound wave as illustrated in [Figure 1](#Figure_14_01_StringR), [Figure 2](#Figure_14_01_StringL), and [Figure 3](#Figure_14_01_Vibrations). As the string oscillates back and forth, part of the string’s energy goes into compressing and expanding the surrounding air. This creates slightly higher and lower pressures. The higher pressure... regions are compressions, and the low pressure regions are . The pressure disturbance moves through the air as  with the same  as the string. Some of the energy is lost in the form of thermal energy transferred to the air. You may recall from the chapter on waves that areas of compression and rarefaction in longitudinal waves (such as sound) are analogous to crests and troughs in .

***Figure 1** A vibrating string moving to the right compresses the air in front of it and expands the air behind it.*

***Figure 2** As the string moves to the left, it creates another compression and rarefaction as the particles on the right move away from the string.*

![A string vibrates back and forth from left to right. The graph of its position is sinusoidal in shape, with amplitude decreasing over time.__ALT__Figure_14_01_Vibrations](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_14_01_Vibrations.jpg)
***Figure 3** After many vibrations, there is a series of compressions and rarefactions that have been transmitted from the string as a sound wave. The graph shows gauge pressure (P) versus distance *x* from the source. Gauge pressure is the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure; it is positive for pressures above atmospheric pressure, and negative for pressures below it. For ordinary, everyday sounds, pressures vary only slightly from average atmospheric pressure.*

The  of a sound wave decreases with distance from its source, because the energy of the wave is spread over a larger and larger area. But some of the energy is also absorbed by objects, such as the eardrum in [Figure 4](#Figure_14_01_Eardrum), and some of the energy is converted to thermal energy in the air. [Figure 3](#Figure_14_01_Vibrations) shows a graph of  versus distance from the vibrating string. From this figure, you can see that the compression of a longitudinal wave is analogous to the peak of a transverse wave, and the rarefaction of a longitudinal wave is analogous to the trough of a transverse wave. Just as a transverse wave alternates between peaks and troughs, a longitudinal wave alternates between compression and rarefaction.

![A sound wave with areas of alternating compression and rarefaction enter an ear canal and eardrum.__ALT__Figure_14_01_Eardrum](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_14_01_Eardrum.jpg)
***Figure 4** Sound wave compressions and rarefactions travel up the ear canal and force the eardrum to vibrate. There is a net force on the eardrum, since the sound wave pressures differ from the atmospheric pressure found behind the eardrum. A complicated mechanism converts the vibrations to nerve impulses, which are then interpreted by the brain.*

## The Speed of Sound

The  of sound varies greatly depending upon the medium it is traveling through. The speed of sound in a medium is determined by a combination of the medium’s rigidity (or compressibility in gases) and its density. The more rigid (or less compressible) the medium, the faster the speed of sound. The greater the density of a medium, the slower the speed of sound. The speed of sound in air is low, because air is compressible. Because liquids and solids are relatively rigid and very difficult to compress, the speed of sound in such media is generally greater than in gases. [Figure __REPLACE_Table_14_01__](#Table_14_01) shows the speed of sound in various media. Since temperature affects density, the speed of sound varies with the temperature of the medium through which it’s traveling to some extent, especially for gases.

## The Relationship Between the Speed of Sound and the Frequency and Wavelength of a Sound Wave
![The photograph shows fireworks exploding in the night sky.__ALT__Figure_14_01_fireworks](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_14_01_Fireworks.jpg)
***Figure 5** When fireworks explode in the sky, the light energy is perceived before the sound energy. Sound travels more slowly than light does. (Dominic Alves, Flickr)*

Sound, like all waves, travels at certain speeds through different media and has the properties of frequency and . Sound travels much slower than light—you can observe this while watching a fireworks display (see [Figure 5](#Figure_14_01_fireworks)), since the flash of an explosion is seen before its sound is heard.

The relationship between the speed of sound, its frequency, and wavelength is the same as for all waves:


where *v* is the speed of sound (in units of m/s), *f*is its frequency (in units of hertz), and    is its wavelength (in units of meters). Recall that wavelength is defined as the distance between adjacent identical parts of a wave. The wavelength of a sound, therefore, is the distance between adjacent identical parts of a sound wave. Just as the distance between adjacent crests in a transverse wave is one wavelength, the distance between adjacent compressions in a sound wave is also one wavelength, as shown in [Figure 6](#Figure_14_01_tuningFork). The frequency of a sound wave is the same as that of the source. For example, a tuning fork vibrating at a given frequency would produce sound waves that oscillate at that same frequency. The frequency of a sound is the number of waves that pass a point per unit time.

![A tuning fork vibrates back and forth, creating sound waves.__ALT__Figure_14_01_tuningFork](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_14_01_TuningFork.jpg)
***Figure 6** A sound wave emanates from a source vibrating at a frequency *f*, propagates at *v*, and has a wavelength   .*


One of the more important properties of sound is that its speed is nearly independent of frequency. If this were not the case, and high-frequency sounds traveled faster, for example, then the farther you were from a band in a football stadium, the more the sound from the low-pitch instruments would lag behind the high-pitch ones. But the music from all instruments arrives in cadence independent of distance, and so all frequencies must travel at nearly the same speed.

Recall that  , and in a given medium under fixed temperature and humidity, *v* is constant. Therefore, the relationship between *f*and    is inverse: The higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength of a sound wave.


The speed of sound can change when sound travels from one medium to another. However, the frequency usually remains the same because it is like a driven oscillation and maintains the frequency of the original source. If *v* changes and *f*remains the same, then the wavelength    must change. Since  , the higher the speed of a sound, the greater its wavelength for a given frequency.

> ## Echolocation
> ![A bat produces sound waves that bounce off of a fly and back to the bat.__ALT__Figure_14_01_Bat](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_14_01_Bat.jpg)
> ***Figure 7** A bat uses sound echoes to find its way about and to catch prey. The time for the echo to return is directly proportional to the distance.*
> 
> Echolocation is the use of reflected sound waves to locate and identify objects. It is used by animals such as bats, dolphins and whales, and is also imitated by humans in SONAR—Sound Navigation and Ranging—and echolocation technology.
> 
> Bats, dolphins and whales use echolocation to navigate and find food in their environment. They locate an object (or obstacle) by emitting a sound and then sensing the reflected sound waves. Since the speed of sound in air is constant, the time it takes for the sound to travel to the object and back gives the animal a sense of the distance between itself and the object. This is called *ranging*. [Figure 7](#Figure_14_01_Bat) shows a bat using echolocation to sense distances.
> 
> Echolocating animals identify an object by comparing the relative intensity of the sound waves returning to each ear to figure out the angle at which the sound waves were reflected. This gives information about the direction, size and shape of the object. Since there is a slight distance in position between the two ears of an animal, the sound may return to one of the ears with a bit of a delay, which also provides information about the position of the object. For example, if a bear is directly to the right of a bat, the echo will return to the bat’s left ear later than to its right ear. If, however, the bear is directly ahead of the bat, the echo would return to both ears at the same time. For an animal without a sense of sight such as a bat, it is important to know *where* other animals are as well as *what* they are; their survival depends on it.
> 
> Principles of echolocation have been used to develop a variety of useful sensing technologies. SONAR, is used by submarines to detect objects underwater and measure water depth. Unlike animal echolocation, which relies on only one transmitter (a mouth) and two receivers (ears), manmade SONAR uses many transmitters and beams to get a more accurate reading of the environment. Radar technologies use the echo of radio waves to locate clouds and storm systems in weather forecasting, and to locate aircraft for air traffic control. Some new cars use echolocation technology to sense obstacles around the car, and warn the driver who may be about to hit something (or even to automatically parallel park). Echolocation technologies and training systems are being developed to help visually impaired people navigate their everyday environments.
