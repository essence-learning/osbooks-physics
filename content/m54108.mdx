### Defining Motion

Our study of physics opens with **kinematics**—the study of **motion** without considering its causes. Objects are in motion everywhere you look. Everything from a tennis game to a space-probe flyby of the planet Neptune involves motion. When you are resting, your heart moves blood through your veins. Even in inanimate objects, atoms are always moving.

How do you know something is moving? The location of an object at any particular time is its **position**. More precisely, you need to specify its position relative to a convenient **reference frame**. Earth is often used as a reference frame, and we often describe the position of an object as it relates to **stationary** objects in that reference frame. For example, a rocket launch would be described in terms of the position of the rocket with respect to Earth as a whole, while a professor’s position could be described in terms of where she is in relation to the nearby white board. In other cases, we use reference frames that are not stationary but are in motion relative to Earth. To describe the position of a person in an airplane, for example, we use the airplane, not Earth, as the reference frame. (See [Figure 02 01 Airplane](Figure_02_01_Airplane).) Thus, you can only know how fast and in what **direction** an object's position is changing against a background of something else that is either not moving or moving with a known **speed** and direction. The reference frame is the coordinate system from which the positions of objects are described.

Your classroom can be used as a reference frame. In the classroom, the walls are not moving. Your motion as you walk to the door, can be measured against the stationary background of the classroom walls. You can also tell if other things in the classroom are moving, such as your classmates entering the classroom or a book falling off a desk. You can also tell in what direction something is moving in the classroom. You might say, “The teacher is moving toward the door.” Your reference frame allows you to determine not only that something is moving but also the direction of motion. 

You could also serve as a reference frame for others’ movement. If you remained seated as your classmates left the room, you would measure their movement away from your stationary location. If you and your classmates left the room together, then your perspective of their motion would be change. You, as the reference frame, would be moving in the same direction as your other moving classmates. As you will learn in the **Snap Lab**, your description of motion can be quite different when viewed from different reference frames.

## History: Galileo's Ship
![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_02_01_Galileo.jpg)<p>Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) studied motion and developed the concept of a reference frame. (Domenico Tintoretto)
</p>
The idea that a description of motion depends on the reference frame of the observer has been known for hundreds of years. The 17<sup>th</sup>-century astronomer **Galileo** Galilei ([Figure 02 01 Galileo](Figure_02_01_Galileo)) was one of the first scientists to explore this idea. Galileo suggested the following thought experiment: Imagine a windowless ship moving at a constant speed and direction along a perfectly calm sea. Is there a way that a person inside the ship can determine whether the ship is moving? You can extend this thought experiment by also imagining a person standing on the shore. How can a person on the shore determine whether the ship is moving?

Galileo came to an amazing conclusion. Only by looking at each other can a person in the ship or a person on shore describe the motion of one relative to the other. In addition, their descriptions of motion would be symmetric or opposite. A person inside the ship would describe the person on the land as moving past the ship. The person on shore would describe the ship and the person inside it as moving past. Galileo realized that observers moving at a constant speed and direction relative to each other describe motion in the same way. Galileo had discovered that a description of motion is only meaningful if you specify a reference frame.

### Distance vs. Displacement

As we study the motion of objects, we must first be able to describe the object’s position. Before your parent drives you to school, the car is sitting in your driveway. Your driveway is the starting position for the car. When you reach your high school, the car has changed position. Its new position is your school. 

![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_02_01_house.jpg)<p>Your total change in position is measured from your house to your school.</p>
Physicists use variables to represent terms. We will use *d* to represent car’s position. We will use a subscript to differentiate between the initial position, *d*0, and the final position, *d*f. In addition, vectors, which we will discuss later, will be in bold or will have an arrow above the variable. Scalars will be italicized.

In some books, *x* or *s* is used instead of *d* to describe position. In *d*0, said *d naught*, the subscript 0 stands for *initial*. When we begin to talk about two-dimensional motion, sometimes other subscripts will be used to describe horizontal position, *d*x, or vertical position, *d*y. So, you might see references to *d*0x and *d*fy.


        Now imagine driving from your house to a friend's house located several kilometers away. How far would you drive? The **distance** an object moves is the length of the path between its initial position and its final position. The distance you drive to your friend's house depends on your path. As shown in [Figure 02 01 comic](Figure_02_01_comic), distance is different from the length of a straight line between two points. The distance you drive to your friend's house is probably longer than the straight line between the two houses.
      

![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_02_01_comic.jpg)<p>A short line separates the starting and ending points of this motion, but the distance along the path of motion is considerably longer.</p>
We often want to be more precise when we talk about position. The description of an object’s motion often includes more than just the distance it moves. For instance, if it is a five kilometer drive to school, the distance traveled is 5 kilometers. After dropping you off at school and driving back home, your parent will have traveled a total distance of 10 kilometers. The car and your parent will end up in the same starting position in space. The net change in position of an object is its **displacement**, or  <math>        <mrow>          <mtext>Δ</mtext> <mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><mi>d</mi></mstyle><mtext>.</mtext>        </mrow>      </math> The Greek letter delta,   The Greek letter delta,  <math>        <mtext>Δ</mtext>      </math>, means , means *change in*.

If you are describing only your drive to school and the route is a straight line, then the distance traveled and the displacement are the same—5 kilometers. When you are describing the entire round trip, distance and displacement are different. When you describe distance, you only include the **magnitude**, the size or amount, of the distance traveled. However, when you describe the displacement, you take into account both the magnitude of the change in position and the direction of movement.

In our previous example, the car travels a total of 10 kilometers, but it drives five of those kilometers forward toward school and five of those kilometers back in the opposite direction. If we ascribe the forward direction a positive (+) and the opposite direction a negative (–), then the two quantities will cancel each other out when added together.

A quantity, such as distance, that has magnitude (i.e., how big or how much) and sometimes a sign (e.g., electric charge, temperature in Celsius, or component of a vector) but does not take into account direction is called a **scalar**. A quantity, such as displacement, that has both magnitude and direction is called a **vector**. A vector with magnitude zero is a special case of a vector that has no direction.

## Vectors & Scalars
This [temporarily unnamed link]() introduces and differentiates between vectors and scalars. It also introduces quantities that we will be working with during the study of kinematics.

### Displacement Problems

Hopefully you now understand the conceptual difference between distance and displacement. Understanding concepts is half the battle in physics. The other half is math. A stumbling block to new physics students is trying to wade through the math of physics while also trying to understand the associated concepts. This struggle may lead to misconceptions and answers that make no sense. Once the concept is mastered, the math is far less confusing.

So let’s review and see if we can make sense of displacement in terms of numbers and equations. You can calculate an object's displacement by subtracting its original position, *d*, from its final position *d*. In math terms that means

<equation id="fs-id1167066782882" class="unnumbered"><label />           <math>            <mrow>              <mtext>Δ</mtext><mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><mi>d</mi></mstyle><mo>=</mo><msub>                <mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><mi>d</mi></mstyle>                <mtext>f</mtext>              </msub>              <mo>−</mo><msub>                <mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><mi>d</mi></mstyle>                <mn>0</mn>              </msub>              <mtext>.</mtext>            </mrow>          </math>        </equation>
If the final position is the same as the initial position, then  <math>          <mrow>            <mtext>Δ</mtext><mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><mi>d</mi></mstyle><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn>          </mrow>        </math> . .

To assign numbers and/or direction to these quantities, we need to define an axis with a positive and a negative direction. We also need to define an origin, or *O*. In [Figure 02 01 arrow](Figure_02_01_arrow), the axis is in a straight line with home at zero and school in the positive direction. If we left home and drove the opposite way from school, motion would have been in the negative direction. We would have assigned it a negative value. In the round-trip drive, *d*f and *d*0 were both at zero kilometers. In the one way trip to school, *d*f was at 5 kilometers and *d*0 was at zero km. So,  <math>          <mrow>            <mi>Δ</mi><mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><mi>d</mi></mstyle>          </mrow>        </math>  was 5 kilometers.   was 5 kilometers. 

You may place your origin wherever you would like. You have to make sure that you calculate all distances consistently from your zero and you define one direction as positive and the other as negative. Therefore, it makes sense to choose the easiest axis, direction, and zero. In the example above, we took home to be zero because it allowed us to avoid having to interpret a solution with a negative sign.

## Calculating Distance and Displacement
A cyclist rides 3 km west and then turns around and rides 2 km east. (a) What is her displacement? (b) What distance does she ride? (c) What is the magnitude of her displacement?

![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_02_01_direction_img.jpg)## Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the final position and the initial position while taking care to note the direction on the axis. The final position is the sum of the two displacements,  <math>                  <mrow>                    <mtext>Δ</mtext><msub>                      <mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><mi>d</mi></mstyle>                      <mn>1</mn>                    </msub>                  </mrow>                </math>  and    and  <math>                  <mrow>                    <mtext>Δ</mtext><msub>                      <mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><mi>d</mi></mstyle>                      <mn>2</mn>                    </msub>                  </mrow>                </math> . .

## Solution
1. Displacement: The rider’s displacement is  <math>                <mrow>                  <mtext>Δ</mtext>                  <mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><mi>d</mi></mstyle><mo>=</mo><msub>                    <mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><mi>d</mi></mstyle>                    <mtext>f</mtext>                  </msub>                  <mo>−</mo><msub>                    <mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><mi>d</mi></mstyle>                    <mn>0</mn>                  </msub>                  <mo>=</mo><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn><mspace width="0.3em" /><mtext> km</mtext>                </mrow>              </math> . .
2. Distance: The distance traveled is 3 km + 2 km = 5 km.
3. The magnitude of the displacement is 1 km.

## Discussion
The displacement is negative because we chose east to be positive and west to be negative. We could also have described the displacement as 1 km west. When calculating displacement, the direction mattered, but when calculating distance, the direction did not matter. The problem would work the same way if the problem were in the north–south or *y*-direction.

Physicists like to use standard units so it is easier to compare notes. The standard units for calculations are called *SI* units (International System of Units). SI units are based on the metric system. The SI unit for displacement is the meter (m), but sometimes you will see a problem with kilometers, miles, feet, or other units of length. If one unit in a problem is an SI unit and another is not, you will need to convert all of your quantities to the same system before you can carry out the calculation.

## Mars Probe Explosion
![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_02_01_Mars.jpg)<p>The Mars Climate Orbiter disaster illustrates the importance of using the correct calculations in physics. (NASA)</p>
Physicists make calculations all the time, but they do not always get the right answers. In 1998, NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, launched the Mars Climate Orbiter, shown in [Figure 02 01 Mars](Figure_02_01_Mars), a $125-million-dollar satellite designed to monitor the Martian atmosphere. It was supposed to orbit the planet and take readings from a safe distance. The American scientists made calculations in English units (feet, inches, pounds, etc.) and forgot to convert their answers to the standard metric SI units. This was a very costly mistake. Instead of orbiting the planet as planned, the Mars Climate Orbiter ended up flying into the Martian atmosphere. The probe disintegrated. It was one of the biggest embarrassments in NASA’s history.
