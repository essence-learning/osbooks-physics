## Simple Machines
make work easier, but they do not decrease the amount of work you have to do. Why can’t simple machines change the amount of work that you do? Recall that in closed systems the total amount of energy is conserved. A machine cannot increase the amount of energy you put into it. So, why is a simple machine useful? Although it cannot change the amount of work you do, a simple machine can change the amount of force you must apply to an object, and the distance over which you apply the force. In most cases, a simple machine is used to reduce the amount of force you must exert to do work. The down side is that you must exert the force over a greater distance, because the product of force and distance, **f***d*, (which equals work) does not change.

Let’s examine how this works in practice. In [Figure 1](#Figure_09_03_lever)(a), the worker uses a type of  to exert a small force over a large distance, while the pry bar pulls up on the nail with a large force over a small distance. [Figure 1](#Figure_09_03_lever)(b) shows the how a lever works mathematically. The effort force, applied at **F**, lifts the load (the resistance force) which is pushing down at **F**. The triangular pivot is called the ; the part of the lever between the fulcrum and **F** is the effort arm, *L*; and the part to the left is the resistance arm, *L*. The  is a number that tells us how many times a simple machine multiplies the effort force. The , *IMA*, is the mechanical advantage of a perfect machine with no loss of useful work caused by friction between moving parts. The equation for *IMA* is shown in [Figure 1](#Figure_09_03_lever)(b).

![Two diagrams are shown side by side. The diagram on the left shows a drawing of a hand pulling a mail out of wood using a lever. The diagram on the right shows an illustration of a lever and a fulcrum. The fulcrum is closer to the left side of the lever than the right side. The distance of the left side of the lever is labeled L subscript r and the distance of the right side is labeled L subscript e. A force vector is pointing down on the left side and is labeled F subscript r, and a force vector is pointing down on the right side and is labeled F subscript e. The equation IMA equals L subscript e over L subscript r is also shown.__ALT__Figure_09_03_lever](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_09_03_levers.jpg)
***Figure 1** (a) A pry bar is a type of lever. (b) The ideal mechanical advantage equals the length of the effort arm divided by the length of the resistance arm of a lever.*

In general, the *IMA* = the resistance force, **F**, divided by the effort force, **F**.*IMA* also equals the distance over which the effort is applied, *d*, divided by the distance the load travels, *d*.


Getting back to conservation of energy, for any simple machine, the work put into the machine, *W*, equals the work the machine puts out, *W*. Combining this with the information in the paragraphs above, we can write


The equations show how a simple machine can output the same amount of work while reducing the amount of effort force by increasing the distance over which the effort force is applied.

> ### Introduction to Mechanical Advantage
> This video shows how to calculate the *IMA* of a lever by three different methods: (1) from effort force and resistance force; (2) from the lengths of the lever arms, and; (3) from the distance over which the force is applied and the distance the load moves.

Some levers exert a large force to a short effort arm. This results in a smaller force acting over a greater distance at the end of the resistance arm. Examples of this type of lever are baseball bats, hammers, and golf clubs. In another type of lever, the fulcrum is at the end of the lever and the load is in the middle, as in the design of a wheelbarrow.


The simple machine shown in [Figure 2](#Figure_09_03_axle) is called a **.** It is actually a form of lever. The difference is that the effort arm can rotate in a complete circle around the fulcrum, which is the center of the axle. Force applied to the outside of the wheel causes a greater force to be applied to the rope that is wrapped around the axle. As shown in the figure, the ideal mechanical advantage is calculated by dividing the radius of the wheel by the radius of the axle. Any crank-operated device is an example of a wheel and axle.

![A diagram of a wheel is shown. The equation IMA equals capital R over lowercase r. A small grey circle is inside a larger blue circle. An arrow labeled lowercase r points from the center of the smaller circle to its edge. An arrow labeled capital R points from the center of the smaller circle to the edge of the larger circle. A mass is attached to the smaller circle and has a force vector, F subscript r, pointing downward from it. Another force vector, F subscript e, points downward and to the right from the edge of the larger circle.__ALT__Figure_09_03_axle](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_09_03_wheel.jpg)
***Figure 2** Force applied to a wheel exerts a force on its axle.*


An  and a  are two forms of the same simple machine. A wedge is simply two inclined planes back to back. [Figure 3](#Figure_09_03_inclined) shows the simple formulas for calculating the *IMA*s of these machines. All sloping, paved surfaces for walking or driving are inclined planes. Knives and axe heads are examples of wedges.

![Two diagrams are shown side-by-side. On the left, an inclined plane is shown. Its horizontal surface distance is labeled L and its height is labeled h. A box is shown on the surface with a force vector that points up the plane. The equation IMA equals L over h is shown. On the right, a wedge is shown. Its horizontal surface distance is labeled L. Its height is labeled t. The equation IMA equals L over t is also shown.__ALT__Figure_09_03_inclined](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_09_03_wedge.jpg)
***Figure 3** An inclined plane is shown on the left, and a wedge is shown on the right.*


The  shown in [Figure 4](#Figure_09_03_screw) is actually a lever attached to a circular inclined plane. Wood screws (of course) are also examples of screws. The lever part of these screws is a screw driver. In the formula for *IMA*, the distance between screw threads is called *pitch* and has the symbol *P*.

![An illustration of a screw is shown. It has a long lever, labeled L. P is pitch, the distance between the threads.__ALT__Figure_09_03_screw](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_09_03_screw.jpg)
***Figure 4** The screw shown here is used to lift very heavy objects, like the corner of a car or a house a short distance.*


[Figure 5](#Figure_09_03_pulley) shows three different  systems. Of all simple machines, mechanical advantage is easiest to calculate for pulleys. Simply count the number of ropes supporting the load. That is the *IMA*. Once again we have to exert force over a longer distance to multiply force. To raise a load 1 meter with a pulley system you have to pull *N* meters of rope. Pulley systems are often used to raise flags and window blinds and are part of the mechanism of construction cranes.

![Three pulley systems are shown in side-by-side diagrams. The first consists of a single pulley and is shown holding a mass. The mass is labeled with a force vector, F r, that also points downward. Another force vector, F e, is shown pointing downward from the pulley. N equals one is also shown. The second pulley system consists of a single pulley holding a mass. A force vector, F e, points upward from the pulley. N equals two is shown. The last pulley system shows four pulleys holding a mass with a hook. A force vector, F e, points downward from the pulley. N equals four is shown.__ALT__Figure_09_03_pulley](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_09_03_pulleys.jpg)
***Figure 5** Three pulley systems are shown here.*

A  is a combination of two or more simple machines. The wire cutters in [Figure 6](#Figure_09_03_wire) combine two levers and two wedges. Bicycles include wheel and axles, levers, screws, and pulleys. Cars and other vehicles are combinations of many machines.

![An illustration shows a pair of hand-held wire cutters.__ALT__Figure_09_03_wire](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_09_03_wirecutter.jpg)
***Figure 6** Wire cutters are a common complex machine.*


## Calculating Mechanical Advantage and Efficiency of Simple Machines
In general, the *IMA* = the resistance force, **F**, divided by the effort force, **F**. *IMA* also equals the distance over which the effort is applied, *d*, divided by the distance the load travels, *d*.


Refer back to the discussions of each simple machine for the specific equations for the *IMA* for each type of machine.

No simple or complex machines have the actual mechanical advantages calculated by the *IMA* equations. In real life, some of the applied work always ends up as wasted heat due to friction between moving parts. Both the  (*W*) and  (*W*) are the result of a force, **F**, acting over a distance, *d*.


The  of a machine is simply the output work divided by the input work, and is usually multiplied by 100 so that it is expressed as a percent.


Look back at the pictures of the simple machines and think about which would have the highest efficiency. Efficiency is related to friction, and friction depends on the smoothness of surfaces and on the area of the surfaces in contact. How would lubrication affect the efficiency of a simple machine?
