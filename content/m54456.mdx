## Changing Magnetic Fields
In the preceding section, we learned that a current creates a magnetic field. If nature is symmetrical, then perhaps a magnetic field can create a current. In 1831, some 12 years after the discovery that an electric current generates a magnetic field, English scientist Michael Faraday (1791–1862) and American scientist Joseph Henry (1797–1878) independently demonstrated that magnetic fields can produce currents. The basic process of generating currents with magnetic fields is called ; this process is also called  to distinguish it from charging by induction, which uses the electrostatic Coulomb force.

When Faraday discovered what is now called Faraday’s law of induction, Queen Victoria asked him what possible use was electricity. “Madam,” he replied, “What good is a baby?” Today, currents induced by magnetic fields are essential to our technological society. The electric generator—found in everything from automobiles to bicycles to nuclear power plants—uses magnetism to generate electric current. Other devices that use magnetism to induce currents include pickup coils in electric guitars, transformers of every size, certain microphones, airport security gates, and damping mechanisms on sensitive chemical balances.

One experiment Faraday did to demonstrate magnetic induction was to move a bar magnet through a wire coil and measure the resulting electric current through the wire. A schematic of this experiment is shown in [Figure 1](#Figure_20_02_Ammeter). He found that current is induced only when the magnet moves with respect to the coil. When the magnet is motionless with respect to the coil, no current is induced in the coil, as in [Figure 1](#Figure_20_02_Ammeter). In addition, moving the magnet in the opposite direction (compare [Figure 1](#Figure_20_02_Ammeter) with [Figure 1](#Figure_20_02_Ammeter)) or reversing the poles of the magnet (compare [Figure 1](#Figure_20_02_Ammeter) with [Figure 1](#Figure_20_02_Ammeter)) results in a current in the opposite direction.

![Movement of a magnet relative to a coil as measured by an ammeter.__ALT__Figure_20_02_Ammeter](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_20_02_ammeter.jpg)
***Figure 1** Movement of a magnet relative to a coil produces electric currents as shown. The same currents are produced if the coil is moved relative to the magnet. The greater the speed, the greater the magnitude of the current, and the current is zero when there is no motion. The current produced by moving the magnet upward is in the opposite direction as the current produced by moving the magnet downward.*

> Try this simulation to see how moving a magnet creates a current in a circuit. A light bulb lights up to show when current is flowing, and a voltmeter shows the voltage drop across the light bulb. Try moving the magnet through a four-turn coil and through a two-turn coil. For the same magnet speed, which coil produces a higher voltage?

## Induced Electromotive Force
If a current is induced in the coil, Faraday reasoned that there must be what he called an *electromotive force* pushing the charges through the coil. This interpretation turned out to be incorrect; instead, the external source doing the work of moving the magnet adds energy to the charges in the coil. The energy added per unit charge has units of volts, so the electromotive force is actually a potential. Unfortunately, the name electromotive force stuck and with it the potential for confusing it with a real force. For this reason, we avoid the term *electromotive force* and just use the abbreviation *emf*, which has the mathematical symbol  <math><mrow> <mi>ε</mi> <mtext>.</mtext> </mrow></math>  The   The  may be defined as the rate at which energy is drawn from a source per unit current flowing through a circuit. Thus, emf is the energy per unit charge *added* by a source, which contrasts with voltage, which is the energy per unit charge*released* as the charges flow through a circuit.

To understand why an emf is generated in a coil due to a moving magnet, consider [Figure 2](#Figure_20_02_Two_mags), which shows a bar magnet moving downward with respect to a wire loop. Initially, seven magnetic field lines are going through the loop (see left-hand image). Because the magnet is moving away from the coil, only five magnetic field lines are going through the loop after a short time  <math> <mrow>  <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>t</mi></mrow></math>  (see right-hand image). Thus, when a change occurs in the number of magnetic field lines going through the area defined by the wire loop, an emf is induced in the wire loop. Experiments such as this show that the induced emf is proportional to the   (see right-hand image). Thus, when a change occurs in the number of magnetic field lines going through the area defined by the wire loop, an emf is induced in the wire loop. Experiments such as this show that the induced emf is proportional to the *rate of change* of the magnetic field. Mathematically, we express this as

<equation id="fs-id1164566544844"> <math display="block"> <mrow>  <mi>ε</mi><mo>∝</mo><mfrac>   <mrow>    <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>B</mi></mrow>   <mrow>    <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>t</mi></mrow>  </mfrac>  <mtext>,</mtext>  </mrow></math> </equation>
where  <math> <mrow>  <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>B</mi></mrow></math>  is the change in the magnitude in the magnetic field during time    is the change in the magnitude in the magnetic field during time  <math> <mrow>  <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>t</mi></mrow></math>  and   and *A* is the area of the loop.

![Part (a) shows seven magnetic field lines going through a wire loop. Part (b) shows that after a period of time, only five magnetic field lines are going through the loop.__ALT__Figure_20_02_Two_mags](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_20_02_twomags.jpg)
***Figure 2** The bar magnet moves downward with respect to the wire loop, so that the number of magnetic field lines going through the loop decreases with time. This causes an emf to be induced in the loop, creating an electric current.*

Note that magnetic field lines that lie in the plane of the wire loop do not actually pass through the loop, as shown by the left-most loop in [Figure 3](#Figure_20_02_Loops). In this figure, the arrow coming out of the loop is a vector whose magnitude is the area of the loop and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of the loop. In [Figure 3](#Figure_20_02_Loops), as the loop is rotated from  <math> <mrow>  <mi>θ</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>90°</mn><mo /></mrow></math> to  
 to  <math> <mrow>  <mi>θ</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0°</mn><mo /></mrow><mtext>,</mtext></math>  the contribution of the magnetic field lines to the emf increases. Thus, what is important in generating an emf in the wire loop is the component of the magnetic field that is   the contribution of the magnetic field lines to the emf increases. Thus, what is important in generating an emf in the wire loop is the component of the magnetic field that is *perpendicular* to the plane of the loop, which is  <math> <mrow>  <mi>B</mi><mi>cos</mi><mi>θ</mi></mrow><mtext>.</mtext></math>

This is analogous to a sail in the wind. Think of the conducting loop as the sail and the magnetic field as the wind. To maximize the force of the wind on the sail, the sail is oriented so that its surface vector points in the same direction as the winds, as in the right-most loop in [Figure 3](#Figure_20_02_Loops). When the sail is aligned so that its surface vector is perpendicular to the wind, as in the left-most loop in [Figure 3](#Figure_20_02_Loops), then the wind exerts no force on the sail.

Thus, taking into account the angle of the magnetic field with respect to the area, the proportionality  <math> <mrow>  <mi>E</mi><mo>∝</mo><mrow><mrow>   <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>B</mi></mrow><mo>/</mo><mrow>   <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>t</mi></mrow></mrow>  </mrow></math>  becomes  becomes

![As a wire loop is rotated through a magnetic field, it generates an emf. The dots show where the magnetic field lines intersect the plane defined by the loop.__ALT__Figure_20_02_Loops](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_20_02_loops.jpg)
***Figure 3** The magnetic field lies in the plane of the left-most loop, so it cannot generate an emf in this case. When the loop is rotated so that the angle of the magnetic field with the vector perpendicular to the area of the loop increases to  <math> <mn>90°</mn></math>  (see right-most loop), the magnetic field contributes maximally to the emf in the loop. The dots show where the magnetic field lines intersect the plane defined by the loop.  (see right-most loop), the magnetic field contributes maximally to the emf in the loop. The dots show where the magnetic field lines intersect the plane defined by the loop.*

Another way to reduce the number of magnetic field lines that go through the conducting loop in [Figure 3](#Figure_20_02_Loops) is not to move the magnet but to make the loop smaller. Experiments show that changing the area of a conducting loop in a stable magnetic field induces an emf in the loop. Thus, the emf produced in a conducting loop is proportional to the rate of change of the *product* of the perpendicular magnetic field and the loop area

<equation id="fs-id1164562175985"> <math display="block"> <mrow>  <mi>ε</mi><mo>∝</mo><mfrac>   <mrow>    <mtext>Δ</mtext><mrow><mo>[</mo> <mrow>     <mrow><mo>(</mo>      <mrow>       <mi>B</mi><mi>cos</mi><mi>θ</mi></mrow>     <mo>)</mo></mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow> <mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow>   <mrow>    <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>t</mi></mrow>  </mfrac>  <mtext>,</mtext>  </mrow></math> </equation>
where  <math> <mrow>  <mi>B</mi><mi>cos</mi><mi>θ</mi></mrow></math>  is the perpendicular magnetic field and   is the perpendicular magnetic field and *A* is the area of the loop. The product  <math> <mrow>  <mi>B</mi><mi>A</mi><mi>cos</mi><mi>θ</mi></mrow></math>  is very important. It is proportional to the number of magnetic field lines that pass perpendicularly through a surface of area   is very important. It is proportional to the number of magnetic field lines that pass perpendicularly through a surface of area *A*. Going back to our sail analogy, it would be proportional to the force of the wind on the sail. It is called the  and is represented by  <math> <mtext>Φ</mtext></math> . .

The unit of magnetic flux is the weber (Wb), which is magnetic field per unit area, or T/m<sup>2</sup>. The weber is also a volt second (Vs).

The induced emf is in fact proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through a conducting loop.

<equation id="fs-id1164563573962"> <math display="block"> <mrow>  <mi>ε</mi><mo>∝</mo><mfrac>   <mrow>    <mi>Δ</mi><mtext>Φ</mtext></mrow>   <mrow>    <mi>Δ</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow>  </mfrac>  </mrow></math> </equation>
Finally, for a coil made from *N* loops, the emf is *N* times stronger than for a single loop. Thus, the emf induced by a changing magnetic field in a coil of *N* loops is

<equation id="fs-id1167064743526" class="unnumbered"><label /> <math> <mrow>  <mi>ε</mi><mo>∝</mo><mi>N</mi><mfrac>   <mrow>    <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>B</mi><mi>cos</mi><mi>θ</mi></mrow>   <mrow>    <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>t</mi></mrow>  </mfrac>  <mi>A.</mi></mrow></math> </equation>
The last question to answer before we can change the proportionality into an equation is “In what direction does the current flow?” The Russian scientist Heinrich Lenz (1804–1865) explained that the current flows in the direction that creates a magnetic field that tries to keep the flux constant in the loop. For example, consider again [Figure 2](#Figure_20_02_Two_mags). The motion of the bar magnet causes the number of upward-pointing magnetic field lines that go through the loop to decrease. Therefore, an emf is generated in the loop that drives a current in the direction that creates more upward-pointing magnetic field lines. By using the right-hand rule, we see that this current must flow in the direction shown in the figure. To express the fact that the induced emf acts to counter the change in the magnetic flux through a wire loop, a minus sign is introduced into the proportionality  <math> <mrow>  <mi>ε</mi><mo>∝</mo><mrow><mrow>   <mtext>Δ</mtext><mtext>Φ</mtext></mrow><mo>/</mo><mrow>   <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>t</mi></mrow></mrow><mtext>.</mtext>  </mrow></math>, which gives Faraday’s law of induction., which gives Faraday’s law of induction.

<equation id="fs-id1164557710862"> <math display="block"> <mrow>  <mi>ε</mi><mo>=</mo><mo>−</mo><mi>N</mi><mfrac>   <mrow>    <mtext>Δ</mtext><mtext>Φ</mtext></mrow>   <mrow>    <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>t</mi></mrow>  </mfrac>  </mrow></math> </equation>
Lenz’s law is very important. To better understand it, consider [Figure 4](#Figure_20_02_LL), which shows a magnet moving with respect to a wire coil and the direction of the resulting current in the coil. In the top row, the north pole of the magnet approaches the coil, so the magnetic field lines from the magnet point toward the coil. Thus, the magnetic field  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mover accent="true">    <mi>B</mi>    <mo>→</mo>   </mover>   <mrow>    <mtext>mag</mtext></mrow>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo><msub>   <mi>B</mi>   <mrow>    <mtext>mag</mtext></mrow>  </msub>  <mrow><mo>(</mo>   <mover accent="true">    <mi>x</mi>    <mo>^</mo>   </mover>  <mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>  pointing to the right increases in the coil. According to Lenz’s law, the emf produced in the coil will drive a current in the direction that creates a magnetic field    pointing to the right increases in the coil. According to Lenz’s law, the emf produced in the coil will drive a current in the direction that creates a magnetic field  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mover accent="true">    <mi>B</mi>    <mo>→</mo>   </mover>   <mrow>    <mtext>coil</mtext></mrow>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo><msub>   <mi>B</mi>   <mrow>    <mtext>coil</mtext></mrow>  </msub>  <mrow><mo>(</mo>   <mrow>    <mo>−</mo><mover accent="true">     <mi>x</mi>     <mo>^</mo>    </mover>    </mrow>  <mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>  inside the coil pointing to the left. This will counter the increase in magnetic flux pointing to the right. To see which way the current must flow, point your right thumb in the desired direction of the magnetic field    inside the coil pointing to the left. This will counter the increase in magnetic flux pointing to the right. To see which way the current must flow, point your right thumb in the desired direction of the magnetic field  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mover accent="true">    <mi>B</mi>    <mo>→</mo>   </mover>   <mrow>    <mtext>coil,</mtext></mrow>  </msub>  </mrow></math>  and the current will flow in the direction indicated by curling your right fingers. This is shown by the image of the right hand in the top row of   and the current will flow in the direction indicated by curling your right fingers. This is shown by the image of the right hand in the top row of [Figure 4](#Figure_20_02_LL). Thus, the current must flow in the direction shown in [Figure 4](#Figure_20_02_LL).

In [Figure 4](#Figure_20_02_LL), the direction in which the magnet moves is reversed. In the coil, the right-pointing magnetic field  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mover accent="true">    <mi>B</mi>    <mo>→</mo>   </mover>   <mrow>    <mtext>mag</mtext></mrow>  </msub>  </mrow></math>  due to the moving magnet decreases. Lenz’s law says that, to counter this decrease, the emf will drive a current that creates an additional right-pointing magnetic field    due to the moving magnet decreases. Lenz’s law says that, to counter this decrease, the emf will drive a current that creates an additional right-pointing magnetic field  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mover accent="true">    <mi>B</mi>    <mo>→</mo>   </mover>   <mrow>    <mtext>coil</mtext></mrow>  </msub>  </mrow></math>  in the coil. Again, point your right thumb in the desired direction of the magnetic field, and the current will flow in the direction indicate by curling your right fingers (  in the coil. Again, point your right thumb in the desired direction of the magnetic field, and the current will flow in the direction indicate by curling your right fingers ([Figure 4](#Figure_20_02_LL)).

Finally, in [Figure 4](#Figure_20_02_LL), the magnet is reversed so that the south pole is nearest the coil. Now the magnetic field  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mover accent="true">    <mi>B</mi>    <mo>→</mo>   </mover>   <mrow>    <mtext>mag</mtext></mrow>  </msub>  </mrow></math>  points toward the magnet instead of toward the coil. As the magnet approaches the coil, it causes the left-pointing magnetic field in the coil to increase. Lenz’s law tells us that the emf induced in the coil will drive a current in the direction that creates a magnetic field pointing to the right. This will counter the increasing magnetic flux pointing to the left due to the magnet. Using the right-hand rule again, as indicated in the figure, shows that the current must flow in the direction shown in   points toward the magnet instead of toward the coil. As the magnet approaches the coil, it causes the left-pointing magnetic field in the coil to increase. Lenz’s law tells us that the emf induced in the coil will drive a current in the direction that creates a magnetic field pointing to the right. This will counter the increasing magnetic flux pointing to the left due to the magnet. Using the right-hand rule again, as indicated in the figure, shows that the current must flow in the direction shown in [Figure 4](#Figure_20_02_LL).

***Figure 4** Lenz’s law tells us that the magnetically induced emf will drive a current that resists the change in the magnetic flux through a circuit. This is shown in panels (a)–(c) for various magnet orientations and velocities. The right hands at right show how to apply the right-hand rule to find in which direction the induced current flows around the coil.*
