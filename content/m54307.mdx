## Heat Engines, Heat Pumps, and Refrigerators
In this section, we’ll explore how heat engines, heat pumps, and refrigerators operate in terms of the laws of thermodynamics.

One of the most important things we can do with heat is to use it to do work for us. A  does exactly this—it makes use of the properties of thermodynamics to transform heat into work. Gasoline and diesel engines, jet engines, and steam turbines that generate electricity are all examples of heat engines.

[Figure 1](#Figure_12_04_Cylinder) illustrates one of the ways in which heat transfers energy to do work. Fuel combustion releases chemical energy that heat transfers throughout the gas in a cylinder. This increases the gas temperature, which in turn increases the pressure of the gas and, therefore, the force it exerts on a movable piston. The gas does work on the outside world, as this force moves the piston through some distance. Thus, heat transfer of energy to the gas in the cylinder results in work being done.

![In part (a), heat transfers energy into the gas in a cylinder. In part (b), force pushes the cylinder. In part (c), heat transfers energy out to the environment.__ALT__Figure_12_04_Cylinder](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_12_04_Cylinder.jpg)
***Figure 1** (a) Heat transfer to the gas in a cylinder increases the internal energy of the gas, creating higher pressure and temperature. (b) The force exerted on the movable cylinder does work as the gas expands. Gas pressure and temperature decrease during expansion, indicating that the gas’s internal energy has decreased as it does work. (c) Heat transfer of energy to the environment further reduces pressure in the gas, so that the piston can more easily return to its starting position.*

To repeat this process, the piston needs to be returned to its starting point. Heat now transfers energy from the gas to the surroundings, so that the gas’s pressure decreases, and a force is exerted by the surroundings to push the piston back through some distance.

A  brings a system, such as the gas in a cylinder, back to its original state at the end of every cycle. All heat engines use cyclical processes.

Heat engines do work by using part of the energy transferred by heat from some source. As shown in [Figure 2](#Figure_12_04_Reservoirs), heat transfers energy,  , from the high-temperature object (or hot reservoir), whereas heat transfers unused energy,  , into the low-temperature object (or cold reservoir), and the work done by the engine is *W*. In physics, a *reservoir* is defined as an infinitely large mass that can take in or put out an unlimited amount of heat, depending upon the needs of the system. The temperature of the hot reservoir is    and the temperature of the cold reservoir is   .

![In part (a), heat transfers energy from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir. In part (b), work is produced as this heat transfers energy from the hot to the cold reservoir. The amount of work generated is Qh – Qc.__ALT__Figure_12_04_Reservoirs](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_12_04_Reservoirs.jpg)
***Figure 2** (a) Heat transfers energy spontaneously from a hot object to a cold one, as is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics. (b) A heat engine, represented here by a circle, uses part of the energy transferred by heat to do work. The hot and cold objects are called the hot and cold reservoirs. *Q* is the heat out of the hot reservoir, *W* is the work output, and *Q* is the unused heat into the cold reservoir.*

As noted, a cyclical process brings the system back to its original condition at the end of every cycle. Such a system’s internal energy, *U*, is the same at the beginning and end of every cycle—that is,   
. The first law of thermodynamics states that    where *Q*is the *net*heat transfer during the cycle, and *W*is the *net* work done by the system. The net heat transfer is the energy transferred in by heat from the hot reservoir minus the amount that is transferred out to the cold reservoir (  ). Because there is no change in internal energy for a complete cycle (  
), we have


so that


Therefore, the net work done by the system equals the net heat into the system, or


for a cyclical process.

Because the hot reservoir is heated externally, which is an energy-intensive process, it is important that the work be done as efficiently as possible. In fact, we want *W* to equal  , and for there to be no heat to the environment (that is,   ). Unfortunately, this is impossible. According to the second law of thermodynamics, heat engines cannot have perfect conversion of heat into work. Recall that entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system, which is also how much energy is unavailable to do work. The second law of thermodynamics requires that the total entropy of a system either increases or remains constant in any process. Therefore, there is a minimum amount of    that cannot be used for work. The amount of heat rejected to the cold reservoir,    depends upon the efficiency of the heat engine. The smaller the increase in entropy,   
, the smaller the value of  , and the more heat energy is available to do work.

, air conditioners, and refrigerators utilize heat transfer of energy from low to high temperatures, which is the opposite of what heat engines do. Heat transfers energy    from a cold reservoir and delivers energy    into a hot one. This requires work input, *W*, which produces a transfer of energy by heat. Therefore, the total heat transfer to the hot reservoir is


The purpose of a heat pump is to transfer energy by heat to a warm environment, such as a home in the winter. The great advantage of using a heat pump to keep your home warm rather than just burning fuel in a fireplace or furnace is that a heat pump supplies   . Heat    comes from the outside air, even at a temperature below freezing, to the indoor space. You only pay for *W*, and you get an additional heat transfer of    from the outside at no cost. In many cases, at least twice as much energy is transferred to the heated space as is used to run the heat pump. When you burn fuel to keep warm, you pay for all of it. The disadvantage to a heat pump is that the work input (required by the second law of thermodynamics) is sometimes more expensive than simply burning fuel, especially if the work is provided by electrical energy.

The basic components of a heat pump are shown in [Figure 3](#Figure_12_04_HeatPump). A working fluid, such as a refrigerant, is used. In the outdoor coils (the evaporator), heat    enters the working fluid from the cold outdoor air, turning it into a gas.

![A complete cycle from evaporator to compressor to condenser to expansion valve is shown. Qc is transferred to the evaporator from outdoors, and the condenser releases Qh indoors.__ALT__Figure_12_04_HeatPump](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_12_04_HeatPump.jpg)
***Figure 3** A simple heat pump has four basic components: (1) an evaporator, (2) a compressor, (3) a condenser, and (4) an expansion valve. In the heating mode, heat transfers    to the working fluid in the evaporator (1) from the colder, outdoor air, turning it into a gas. The electrically driven compressor (2) increases the temperature and pressure of the gas and forces it into the condenser coils (3) inside the heated space. Because the temperature of the gas is higher than the temperature in the room, heat transfers energy from the gas to the room as the gas condenses into a liquid. The working fluid is then cooled as it flows back through an expansion valve (4) to the outdoor evaporator coils.*

The electrically driven compressor (work input *W*) raises the temperature and pressure of the gas and forces it into the condenser coils that are inside the heated space. Because the temperature of the gas is higher than the temperature inside the room, heat transfers energy to the room, and the gas condenses into a liquid. The liquid then flows back through an expansion (pressure-reducing) valve. The liquid, having been cooled through expansion, returns to the outdoor evaporator coils to resume the cycle.

The quality of a heat pump is judged by how much energy is transferred by heat into the warm space (  ) compared with how much input work (*W*) is required.


![In a refrigerator, there is heat transfer (Qc) into the system from a cold reservoir, and heat transfer (Qh) out of the system into a hot reservoir, caused by work (W) done on the system.__ALT__Figure_12_04_Fridge](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_12_04_Fridge.jpg)
***Figure 4** Heat pumps, air conditioners, and refrigerators are heat engines operated backward. Almost every home contains a refrigerator. Most people don’t realize that they are also sharing their homes with a heat pump.*

Air conditioners and refrigerators are designed to cool substances by transferring energy by heat    out of a cool environment to a warmer one, where heat    is given up. In the case of a refrigerator, heat is moved out of the inside of the fridge into the surrounding room. For an air conditioner, heat is transferred outdoors from inside a home. Heat pumps are also often used in a reverse setting to cool rooms in the summer.

As with heat pumps, work input is required for heat transfer of energy from cold to hot. The quality of air conditioners and refrigerators is judged by how much energy is removed by heat    from a cold environment, compared with how much work, *W*, is required. So, what is considered the energy benefit in a heat pump, is considered waste heat in a refrigerator.

## Thermal Efficiency
In the conversion of energy into work, we are always faced with the problem of getting less out than we put in. The problem is that, in all processes, there is some heat    that transfers energy to the environment—and usually a very significant amount at that. A way to quantify how efficiently a machine runs is through a quantity called .

We define thermal efficiency, *Eff*, to be the ratio of useful energy output to the energy input (or, in other words, the ratio of what we get to what we spend). The efficiency of a heat engine is the output of net work, *W*, divided by heat-transferred energy,  , into the engine; that is



An efficiency of 1, or 100 percent, would be possible only if there were no heat to the environment (  
).

> All values of heat (   and   ) are positive; there is no such thing as negative heat. The *direction* of heat is indicated by a plus or minus sign. For example,    is out of the system, so it is preceded by a minus sign in the equation for net heat.
