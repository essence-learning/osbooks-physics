### Heat Engines, Heat Pumps, and Refrigerators

In this section, we’ll explore how heat engines, heat pumps, and refrigerators operate in terms of the laws of thermodynamics.

One of the most important things we can do with heat is to use it to do work for us. A **heat engine** does exactly this—it makes use of the properties of thermodynamics to transform heat into work. Gasoline and diesel engines, jet engines, and steam turbines that generate electricity are all examples of heat engines.

[Figure 12 04 Cylinder](Figure_12_04_Cylinder) illustrates one of the ways in which heat transfers energy to do work. Fuel combustion releases chemical energy that heat transfers throughout the gas in a cylinder. This increases the gas temperature, which in turn increases the pressure of the gas and, therefore, the force it exerts on a movable piston. The gas does work on the outside world, as this force moves the piston through some distance. Thus, heat transfer of energy to the gas in the cylinder results in work being done.

![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_12_04_Cylinder.jpg)<p>(a) Heat transfer to the gas in a cylinder increases the internal energy of the gas, creating higher pressure and temperature. (b) The force exerted on the movable cylinder does work as the gas expands. Gas pressure and temperature decrease during expansion, indicating that the gas’s internal energy has decreased as it does work. (c) Heat transfer of energy to the environment further reduces pressure in the gas, so that the piston can more easily return to its starting position.</p>
To repeat this process, the piston needs to be returned to its starting point. Heat now transfers energy from the gas to the surroundings, so that the gas’s pressure decreases, and a force is exerted by the surroundings to push the piston back through some distance.

A **cyclical process** brings a system, such as the gas in a cylinder, back to its original state at the end of every cycle. All heat engines use cyclical processes.

Heat engines do work by using part of the energy transferred by heat from some source. As shown in [Figure 12 04 Reservoirs](Figure_12_04_Reservoirs), heat transfers energy,  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>Q</mi>   <mtext>h</mtext>  </msub> </mrow></math>, from the high-temperature object (or hot reservoir), whereas heat transfers unused energy,  , from the high-temperature object (or hot reservoir), whereas heat transfers unused energy,  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>Q</mi>   <mtext>c</mtext>  </msub> </mrow></math>, into the low-temperature object (or cold reservoir), and the work done by the engine is , into the low-temperature object (or cold reservoir), and the work done by the engine is *W*. In physics, a *reservoir* is defined as an infinitely large mass that can take in or put out an unlimited amount of heat, depending upon the needs of the system. The temperature of the hot reservoir is  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>T</mi>   <mtext>h</mtext>  </msub>  <mtext>,</mtext> </mrow></math>  and the temperature of the cold reservoir is    and the temperature of the cold reservoir is  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>T</mi>   <mtext>c</mtext>  </msub> </mrow></math> . .

(b) A heat engine, represented here by a circle, uses part of the energy transferred by heat to do work. The hot and cold objects are called the hot and cold reservoirs. </p>
As noted, a cyclical process brings the system back to its original condition at the end of every cycle. Such a system’s internal energy, *U*, is the same at the beginning and end of every cycle—that is,  <math> <mrow>  <mi>Δ</mi><mi>U</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn> </mrow></math> .

The net heat transfer is the energy transferred in by heat from the hot reservoir minus the amount that is transferred out to the cold reservoir ( <math> <mrow>  <mi>Q</mi><mo>=</mo><msub>   <mi>Q</mi>   <mtext>h</mtext>  </msub>  <mo>−</mo><msub>   <mi>Q</mi>   <mtext>c</mtext>  </msub> </mrow></math> ).

<equation id="fs-id1164566407775"> <math display="block"> <mrow>  <mi>W</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>Q</mi><mtext>.</mtext> </mrow></math> </equation>

for a cyclical process.

Because the hot reservoir is heated externally, which is an energy-intensive process, it is important that the work be done as efficiently as possible. In fact, we want *W* to equal  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>Q</mi>   <mtext>h</mtext>  </msub> </mrow></math>, and for there to be no heat to the environment (that is,  , and for there to be no heat to the environment (that is,  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>Q</mi>   <mtext>c</mtext>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn> </mrow></math> ). Unfortunately, this is impossible. According to the second law of thermodynamics, heat engines cannot have perfect conversion of heat into work.

The second law of thermodynamics requires that the total entropy of a system either increases or remains constant in any process. Therefore, there is a minimum amount of   ).

**Heat pumps**, air conditioners, and refrigerators utilize heat transfer of energy from low to high temperatures, which is the opposite of what heat engines do.

This requires work input,   into a hot one. This requires work input, *W*, which produces a transfer of energy by heat. Therefore, the total heat transfer to the hot reservoir is

The purpose of a heat pump is to transfer energy by heat to a warm environment, such as a home in the winter. The great advantage of using a heat pump to keep your home warm rather than just burning fuel in a fireplace or furnace is that a heat pump supplies  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>Q</mi>   <mtext>h</mtext>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo><msub>   <mi>Q</mi>   <mtext>c</mtext>  </msub>  <mo>+</mo><mi>W</mi> </mrow></math> .

The basic components of a heat pump are shown in [Figure 12 04 HeatPump](Figure_12_04_HeatPump). A working fluid, such as a refrigerant, is used. In the outdoor coils (the evaporator), heat  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>Q</mi>   <mtext>c</mtext>  </msub> </mrow></math>  enters the working fluid from the cold outdoor air, turning it into a gas.  enters the working fluid from the cold outdoor air, turning it into a gas.

The electrically driven compressor (work input *W*) raises the temperature and pressure of the gas and forces it into the condenser coils that are inside the heated space. Because the temperature of the gas is higher than the temperature inside the room, heat transfers energy to the room, and the gas condenses into a liquid. The liquid then flows back through an expansion (pressure-reducing) valve. The liquid, having been cooled through expansion, returns to the outdoor evaporator coils to resume the cycle.

The quality of a heat pump is judged by how much energy is transferred by heat into the warm space ( <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>Q</mi>   <mtext>h</mtext>  </msub> </mrow></math> ) compared with how much input work ( ) compared with how much input work (*W*) is required.

For an air conditioner, heat is transferred outdoors from inside a home. Heat pumps are also often used in a reverse setting to cool rooms in the summer.

As with heat pumps, work input is required for heat transfer of energy from cold to hot. The quality of air conditioners and refrigerators is judged by how much energy is removed by heat  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>Q</mi>   <mtext>c</mtext>  </msub> </mrow></math>  from a cold environment, compared with how much work,   from a cold environment, compared with how much work, *W*, is required. So, what is considered the energy benefit in a heat pump, is considered waste heat in a refrigerator.



### Thermal Efficiency

In the conversion of energy into work, we are always faced with the problem of getting less out than we put in. The problem is that, in all processes, there is some heat  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>Q</mi>   <mtext>c</mtext>  </msub> </mrow></math>  that transfers energy to the environment—and usually a very significant amount at that. A way to quantify how efficiently a machine runs is through a quantity called   that transfers energy to the environment—and usually a very significant amount at that. A way to quantify how efficiently a machine runs is through a quantity called **thermal efficiency**.

We define thermal efficiency, *Eff*, to be the ratio of useful energy output to the energy input (or, in other words, the ratio of what we get to what we spend). The efficiency of a heat engine is the output of net work, *W*, divided by heat-transferred energy,  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>Q</mi>   <mtext>h</mtext>  </msub> </mrow></math>, into the engine; that is, into the engine; that is

An efficiency of 1, or 100 percent, would be possible only if there were no heat to the environment ( <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>Q</mi>   <mtext>c</mtext>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn> </mrow></math> ).

### Solving Thermal Efficiency Problems

## Daily Work Done by a Coal-Fired Power Station and Its Efficiency
A coal-fired power station is a huge heat engine. It uses heat to transfer energy from burning coal to do work to turn turbines, which are used then to generate electricity. In a single day, a large coal power station transfers  <math> <mrow>  <mn>2.50</mn><mo>×</mo><msup>   <mrow>    <mn>10</mn>   </mrow>   <mrow>    <mn>14</mn>   </mrow>  </msup>  <mtext>J</mtext> </mrow></math>  by heat from burning coal and transfers    by heat from burning coal and transfers  <math> <mrow>  <mn>1.48</mn><mo>×</mo><msup>   <mrow>    <mn>10</mn>   </mrow>   <mrow>    <mn>14</mn>   </mrow>  </msup>  <mtext>J</mtext> </mrow></math>  by heat into the environment.

## Discussion
The efficiency found is close to the usual value of 42 percent for coal-burning power stations. It means that fully 59.2 percent of the energy is transferred by heat to the environment, which usually results in warming lakes, rivers, or the ocean near the power station and is implicated in a warming planet generally. While the laws of thermodynamics limit the efficiency of such plants—including plants fired by nuclear fuel, oil, and natural gas—the energy transferred by heat to the environment could be, and sometimes is, used for heating homes or for industrial processes.

### Performance Task

You have been tasked to design and construct a thermometer that works on the principle of thermal expansion. There are four materials available for you to test, each of which will find use under different sets of conditions and temperature ranges:

* Materials
* Four sample materials with similar mass or volume: copper, steel, water, and alcohol (ethanol or isopropanol)
* Oven or similar heating source
* Instrument (e.g., meter ruler, Vernier calipers, or micrometer) for measuring changes in dimension
* Balance for measuring mass

1. Procedure
2. Design a safe experiment to analyze the thermal expansion properties of each material.
3. Write down the materials needed for your experiment and the procedure you will follow. Make sure that you include every detail so that the experiment can be repeated by others.
4. Select an appropriate material to measure temperature over a predecided temperature range, and give reasons for your choice.
5. Calibrate your instrument to measure temperature changes accurately.

1. Which physical quantities are affected by temperature change and thermal expansion?
2. How do such properties as specific heat and thermal conductivity affect the use of each material as a thermometer?
3. Does a change of phase take place for any of the tested materials over the temperature range to be examined?
4. What are your independent and dependent variables for this series of tests? Which variables need to be controlled in the experiment?
5. What are your sources of error?
6. Can all the tested materials be used effectively in the same ranges of temperature? Which applications might be suitable for one or more of the tested substances but not the others?
