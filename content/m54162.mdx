## Properties of Projectile Motion
is the motion of an object thrown (projected) into the air when, after the initial force that launches the object, air resistance is negligible and the only other force that object experiences is the force of gravity. The object is called a , and its path is called its .  is a frictional force that slows its motion and can significantly alter the trajectory of the motion. Due to the difficulty in calculation, only situations in which the deviation from projectile motion is negligible and air resistance can be ignored are considered in introductory physics. That approximation is often quite accurate.


The most important concept in projectile motion is that when air resistance is ignored, *horizontal and vertical motions are* , meaning that they don’t influence one another. [Figure 1](#Figure_05_03_cannonball) compares a cannonball in free fall (in blue) to a cannonball launched horizontally in projectile motion (in red). You can see that the cannonball in free fall falls at the same rate as the cannonball in projectile motion. Keep in mind that if the cannon launched the ball with any vertical component to the velocity, the vertical displacements would not line up perfectly.

Since vertical and horizontal motions are independent, we can analyze them separately, along perpendicular axes. To do this, we separate projectile motion into the two components of its motion, one along the horizontal axis and the other along the vertical.

Dotted line C shows the ball moving horizontally.__ALT__Figure_05_03_cannonball](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_05_03_cannonball.jpg)
***Figure 1** The diagram shows the projectile motion of a cannonball shot at a horizontal angle versus one dropped with no horizontal velocity. Note that both cannonballs have the same vertical position over time.*

We’ll call the horizontal axis the *x*-axis and the vertical axis the *y*-axis. For notation, **d** is the total displacement, and **x** and **y** are its components along the horizontal and vertical axes. The magnitudes of these vectors are *x* and *y*, as illustrated in [Figure 2](#Figure_05_03_soccer).

***Figure 2** A boy kicks a ball at angle *θ*, and it is displaced a distance of **s** along its trajectory.*

As usual, we use velocity, acceleration, and displacement to describe motion. We must also find the components of these variables along the *x*- and *y*-axes. The components of acceleration are then very simple **a** = –**g** = –9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup>. Note that this definition defines the upwards direction as positive. Because gravity is vertical, **a** = 0. Both accelerations are constant, so we can use the kinematic equations. For review, the kinematic equations from a previous chapter are summarized in [Figure __REPLACE_Table_05_01__](#Table_05_01).

Where **x** is position, **x** is initial position, **v** is velocity, **v** is average velocity, *t* is time and a is acceleration.

## Solve Problems Involving Projectile Motion
The following steps are used to analyze projectile motion:

* Separate the motion into horizontal and vertical components along the x- and y-axes. These axes are perpendicular, so    and   are used. The magnitudes of the displacement  along x- and y-axes are called  and  The magnitudes of the components of the velocity  are  and , where  is the magnitude of the velocity and  is its direction. Initial values are denoted with a subscript 0.
* Treat the motion as two independent one-dimensional motions, one horizontal and the other vertical. The kinematic equations for horizontal and vertical motion take the following forms
        
        Vertical motion (assuming positive is up  )
* Solve for the unknowns in the two separate motions (one horizontal and one vertical). Note that the only common variable between the motions is time  . The problem solving procedures here are the same as for one-dimensional kinematics.
* Recombine the two motions to find the total displacement  and velocity  . We can use the analytical method of vector addition, which uses  and  to find the magnitude and direction of the total displacement and velocity.
      is the direction of the displacement , and  is the direction of the velocity  . (See [Figure 3](#Figure_05_03_projectile)
      ![Four related diagrams of projectile motion are show, a, b, c, and d. Diagram a shows two-dimensional curved motion, vx and vy, along an x-y axis and includes the formulas V y equals negative V oy and angle equals negative angle o. Diagram b shows horizontal motion, vx. Diagram c shows upward and downward vertical velocity, vy. And diagram d shows the combination of vx, vy, and v, forming a right triangle.__ALT__Figure_05_03_projectile](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_05_03_projectile.jpg)
***Figure 3** (a) We analyze two-dimensional projectile motion by breaking it into two independent one-dimensional motions along the vertical and horizontal axes. (b) The horizontal motion is simple, because  and  is thus constant. (c) The velocity in the vertical direction begins to decrease as the object rises; at its highest point, the vertical velocity is zero. As the object falls towards the Earth again, the vertical velocity increases again in magnitude but points in the opposite direction to the initial vertical velocity. (d) The *x*- and *y*-motions are recombined to give the total velocity at any given point on the trajectory.*

The expression we found for   while solving part (a) of the previous problem works for any projectile motion problem where air resistance is negligible. Call the maximum height  ; then,


This equation defines the . The maximum height depends only on the vertical component of the initial velocity.

## Practice Problems


The fact that vertical and horizontal motions are independent of each other lets us predict the range of a projectile. The **range** is the horizontal distance **R** traveled by a projectile on level ground, as illustrated in [Figure 4](#Figure_05_03_trajectory). Throughout history, people have been interested in finding the range of projectiles for practical purposes, such as aiming cannons.

![Two trajectory diagrams are shown. Diagram a shows three trajectories that curve upward then downward. They are labeled as follows: thirty meters per second and ninety-eight point one meters; forty meters per second and one hundred sixty-three meters; fifty meters per second and two hundred fifty-five meters. Diagram b shows three trajectories that curve upward then downward. They are labeled as follows: fifteen degrees and one hundred twenty-eight meters; forty-five degrees and two hundred fifty-five meters; seventy-five degrees and one hundred twenty-eight meters. The diagram also includes the formula v o equals fifty meters per second.__ALT__Figure_05_03_trajectory](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_05_03_trajectory.jpg)
***Figure 4** Trajectories of projectiles on level ground. (a) The greater the initial speed , the greater the range for a given initial angle. (b) The effect of initial angle  on the range of a projectile with a given initial speed. Note that any combination of trajectories that add to 90 degrees will have the same range in the absence of air resistance, although the maximum heights of those paths are different.*

How does the initial velocity of a projectile affect its range? Obviously, the greater the initial speed , the greater the range, as shown in the figure above. The initial angle  also has a dramatic effect on the range. When air resistance is negligible, the range  of a projectile on *level ground* is


where  is the initial speed and  is the initial angle relative to the horizontal. It is important to note that the range doesn’t apply to problems where the initial and final y position are different, or to cases where the object is launched perfectly horizontally.

> ### Projectile Motion
> In this simulation you will learn about projectile motion by blasting objects out of a cannon. You can choose between objects such as a tank shell, a golf ball or even a Buick. Experiment with changing the angle, initial speed, and mass, and adding in air resistance. Make a game out of this simulation by trying to hit the target.

## Section Summary
* Projectile motion is the motion of an object through the air that is subject only to the acceleration of gravity.
* Projectile motion in the horizontal and vertical directions are independent of one another.
* The maximum height of an projectile is the highest altitude, or maximum displacement in the vertical position reached in the path of a projectile.
* The range is the maximum horizontal distance traveled by a projectile.
* To solve projectile problems: choose a coordinate system; analyze the motion in the vertical and horizontal direction separately; then, recombine the horizontal and vertical components using vector addition equations.
