### Mechanical Waves

What do we mean when we say something is a wave? A **wave** is a disturbance that travels or *propagates* from the place where it was created. Waves transfer energy from one place to another, but they do not necessarily transfer any mass. Light, sound, and waves in the ocean are common examples of waves. Sound and water waves are **mechanical waves**; meaning, they require a medium to travel through. The **medium** may be a solid, a liquid, or a gas, and the speed of the wave depends on the material properties of the medium through which it is traveling. However, light is not a mechanical wave; it can travel through a vacuum such as the empty parts of outer space.

A familiar wave that you can easily imagine is the water wave. For water waves, the disturbance is in the surface of the water, an example of which is the disturbance created by a rock thrown into a pond or by a swimmer splashing the water surface repeatedly. For sound waves, the disturbance is caused by a change in air pressure, an example of which is when the oscillating cone inside a speaker creates a disturbance. For earthquakes, there are several types of disturbances, which include the disturbance of Earth’s surface itself and the pressure disturbances under the surface. Even radio waves are most easily understood using an analogy with water waves. Because water waves are common and visible, visualizing water waves may help you in studying other types of waves, especially those that are not visible.

Water waves have characteristics common to all waves, such as **amplitude**, **period**, **frequency**, and **energy**, which we will discuss in the next section.



### Pulse Waves and Periodic Waves

If you drop a pebble into the water, only a few waves may be generated before the disturbance dies down, whereas in a wave pool, the waves are continuous. A **pulse wave** is a sudden disturbance in which only one wave or a few waves are generated, such as in the example of the pebble. Thunder and explosions also create pulse waves. A **periodic wave** repeats the same oscillation for several cycles, such as in the case of the wave pool, and is associated with simple harmonic motion. Each particle in the medium experiences simple harmonic motion in periodic waves by moving back and forth periodically through the same positions.

Consider the simplified water wave in [Figure 13 01 SimpleWave](Figure_13_01_SimpleWave). This wave is an up-and-down disturbance of the water surface, characterized by a sine wave pattern. The uppermost position is called the *crest* and the lowest is the *trough*. It causes a seagull to move up and down in simple harmonic motion as the wave crests and troughs pass under the bird.

### Longitudinal Waves and Transverse Waves

Mechanical waves are categorized by their type of motion and fall into any of two categories: transverse or longitudinal. Note that both transverse and longitudinal waves can be periodic. A **transverse wave** propagates so that the disturbance is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. An example of a transverse wave is shown in [Figure 13 01 Transverse](Figure_13_01_Transverse), where a woman moves a toy spring up and down, generating waves that propagate away from herself in the horizontal direction while disturbing the toy spring in the vertical direction.

![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_13_01_TransverseWave.jpg)<caption>In this example of a transverse wave, the wave propagates horizontally and the disturbance in the toy spring is in the vertical direction.</caption>
In contrast, in a **longitudinal wave**, the disturbance is parallel to the direction of propagation. [Figure 13 01 Longitudin](Figure_13_01_Longitudin) shows an example of a longitudinal wave, where the woman now creates a disturbance in the horizontal direction—which is the same direction as the wave propagation—by stretching and then compressing the toy spring.

![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_13_01_Longitudin.jpg)<caption>In this example of a longitudinal wave, the wave propagates horizontally and the disturbance in the toy spring is also in the horizontal direction.</caption>
Longitudinal waves are sometimes called *compression waves *or* compressional waves*, and transverse waves are sometimes called *shear waves*.

Waves may be transverse, longitudinal, or *a combination of the two*. The waves on the strings of musical instruments are transverse (as shown in [Figure 13 01 GuitarWave](Figure_13_01_GuitarWave)), and so are electromagnetic waves, such as visible light. Sound waves in air and water are longitudinal. Their disturbances are periodic variations in pressure that are transmitted in fluids.

![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_13_01_GuitarWave.jpg)<caption>The wave on a guitar string is transverse. However, the sound wave coming out of a speaker rattles a sheet of paper in a direction that shows that such sound wave is longitudinal.</caption>
Sound in solids can be both longitudinal and transverse. Essentially, water waves are also a combination of transverse and longitudinal components, although the simplified water wave illustrated in [Figure 13 01 SimpleWave](Figure_13_01_SimpleWave) does not show the longitudinal motion of the bird.

Earthquake waves under Earth’s surface have both longitudinal and transverse components as well. The longitudinal waves in an earthquake are called pressure or P-waves, and the transverse waves are called shear or S-waves. These components have important individual characteristics; for example, they propagate at different speeds. Earthquakes also have surface waves that are similar to surface waves on water.

## Introduction to Waves
This video explains wave propagation in terms of momentum using an example of a wave moving along a rope. It also covers the differences between transverse and longitudinal waves, and between pulse and periodic waves.

## The Physics of Surfing
Many people enjoy surfing in the ocean. For some surfers, the bigger the wave, the better. In one area off the coast of central California, waves can reach heights of up to 50 feet in certain times of the year ([Figure 13 01 Surfers](Figure_13_01_Surfers)).

![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_13_01_Surfers.jpg)<caption>A surfer negotiates a steep take-off on a winter day in California while his friend watches. (Ljsurf, Wikimedia Commons)</caption>
How do waves reach such extreme heights? Other than unusual causes, such as when earthquakes produce tsunami waves, most huge waves are caused simply by interactions between the wind and the surface of the water. The wind pushes up against the surface of the water and transfers energy to the water in the process. The stronger the wind, the more energy transferred. As waves start to form, a larger surface area becomes in contact with the wind, and even more energy is transferred from the wind to the water, thus creating higher waves. Intense storms create the fastest winds, kicking up massive waves that travel out from the origin of the storm. Longer-lasting storms and those storms that affect a larger area of the ocean create the biggest waves since they transfer more energy. The cycle of the tides from the Moon’s gravitational pull also plays a small role in creating waves.

Actual ocean waves are more complicated than the idealized model of the simple transverse wave with a perfect sinusoidal shape. Ocean waves are examples of *orbital progressive waves*, where water particles at the surface follow a circular path from the crest to the trough of the passing wave, then cycle back again to their original position. This cycle repeats with each passing wave.

As waves reach shore, the water depth decreases and the energy of the wave is compressed into a smaller volume. This creates higher waves—an effect known as *shoaling*.

Since the water particles along the surface move from the crest to the trough, surfers hitch a ride on the cascading water, gliding along the surface. If ocean waves work exactly like the idealized transverse waves, surfing would be much less exciting as it would simply involve standing on a board that bobs up and down in place, just like the seagull in the previous figure.

Additional information and illustrations about the scientific principles behind surfing can be found in the [temporarily unnamed link]() video.
