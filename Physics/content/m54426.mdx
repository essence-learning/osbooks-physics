As you learned in studying gravity, a mass in a gravitational field has **potential energy**, which means it has the potential to accelerate and thereby increase its **kinetic energy**. This kinetic energy can be used to do work. For example, imagine you want to use a stone to pound a nail into a piece of wood. You first lift the stone high above the nail, which increases the potential energy of the stone-Earth system—because Earth is so large, it does not move, so we usually shorten this by saying simply that the potential energy of the stone increases. When you drop the stone, gravity converts the potential energy into kinetic energy. When the stone hits the nail, it does work by pounding the nail into the wood. The gravitational potential energy is the work that a mass can potentially do by virtue of its position in a gravitational field. Potential energy is a very useful concept, because it can be used with conservation of energy to calculate the motion of masses in a gravitational field.

**Electric potential energy** works much the same way, but it is based on the electric field instead of the gravitational field. By virtue of its position in an electric field, a charge has an electric potential energy. If the charge is free to move, the force due to the electric field causes it to accelerate, so its potential energy is converted to kinetic energy, just like a mass that falls in a gravitational field. This kinetic energy can be used to do work. The electric potential energy is the work that a charge can do by virtue of its position in an electric field.

The analogy between gravitational potential energy and electric potential energy is depicted in [Figure 18 04 gravelecpe](Figure_18_04_gravelecpe). On the left, the ball-Earth system gains gravitational potential energy when the ball is higher in Earth's gravitational field. On the right, the two-charge system gains electric potential energy when the positive charge is farther from the negative charge.

The higher the ball is in the gravitational field, the higher the potential energy is of the Earth-ball system. On the right, the electric field points toward a negative charge. The farther the positive charge is from the negative charge, the higher the potential energy is of the two-charge system.</p>

[Figure 18 04 constantfi](Figure_18_04_constantfi) shows how this analogy would work if we were close to Earth’s surface, where gravity is constant. The top image shows a charge accelerating due to a constant electric field. Likewise, the round mass in the bottom image accelerates due to a constant gravitation field. In both cases, the potential energy of the particle decreases, and its kinetic energy increases.

## Analogy between Gravity and Electricity
This video discusses the analogy between gravitational potential energy and electric potential energy. It reviews the concepts of work and potential energy and shows the connection between a mass in a uniform gravitation field, such as on Earth’s surface, and an electric charge in a uniform electric field.

We start by placing charge  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>q</mi>   <mn>1</mn>  </msub>  </mrow></math>  at the origin of our coordinate system.

The maximum amount of work the two charges can do (if they fly infinitely far from each other) is given by the equation above.

Notice that if the two charges have opposite signs, then the potential energy is negative. This means that the charges have more potential to do work when they are *far* apart than when they are at a distance *r* apart. This makes sense: Opposite charges attract, so the charges can gain more kinetic energy if they attract each other from far away than if they start at only a short distance apart. Thus, they have more potential to do work when they are far apart. [Figure 18 04 PEtwocha](Figure_18_04_PEtwocha) summarizes how the electric potential energy depends on charge and separation.

![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_18_04_PEtwocha.jpg)<p>The potential energy depends on the sign of the charges and their separation. The arrows on the charges indicate the direction in which the charges would move if released. When charges with the same sign are far apart, their potential energy is low, as shown in the top panel for two positive charges. The situation is the reverse for charges of opposite signs, as shown in the bottom panel.</p>
### Electric Potential

Recall that to find the force applied by a fixed charge *Q* on any arbitrary test charge *q*, it was convenient to define the electric field, which is the force per unit charge applied by *Q* on any test charge that we place in its electric field. The same Strategy is used here with electric potential energy: We now define the **electric potential** *V*, which is the electric potential energy per unit charge.

<equation id="fs-id1167062304791"><label /> <math> <mrow>  <mi>V</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mrow>    <msub>     <mi>U</mi>     <mtext>E</mtext>    </msub>    </mrow>   <mi>q</mi>  </mfrac>  </mrow></math></equation>
Normally, the electric potential is simply called the *potential* or ****. The units for the potential are J/C, which are given the name *volt* (V) after the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745–1827). From the equation  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>U</mi>   <mtext>E</mtext>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow>   <mi>k</mi><msub>    <mi>q</mi>    <mn>1</mn>   </msub>   <msub>    <mi>q</mi>    <mn>2</mn>   </msub>   </mrow><mo>/</mo><mi>r</mi></mrow>  </mrow></math>, the electric potential a distance , the electric potential a distance *r* from a point charge  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>q</mi>   <mn>1</mn>  </msub>  </mrow></math>  is  is

Note that this equation actually represents a *difference* in electric potential. However, because the second term is zero, it is normally not written, and we speak of the electric potential instead of the electric **potential difference**, or we just say the potential difference, or voltage). Below, when we consider the electric potential energy per unit charge between two points not infinitely far apart, we speak of electric potential *difference* explicitly. Just remember that electric potential and electric potential difference are really the same thing; the former is used just when the electric potential energy is zero in either the initial or final charge configuration.

Now consider the electric potential near a group of charges *q*1, *q*2, and *q*3, as drawn in [Figure 18 04 groupcha](Figure_18_04_groupcha). The electric potential is derived by considering the electric field. Electric fields follow the principle of superposition and can be simply added together, so the electric potential from different charges also add together. Thus, the electric potential of a point near a group of charges is

which means that the electric field has units of V/m. Thus, if you know the potential difference between two points, calculating the electric field is very simple—you simply divide the potential difference by the distance!

Notice that a positive charge in a region with high potential will experience a force pushing it toward regions of lower potential. In this sense, potential is like pressure for fluids. Imagine a pipe containing fluid, with the fluid at one end of the pipe under high pressure and the fluid at the other end of the pipe under low pressure. If nothing prevents the fluid from flowing, it will flow from the high-pressure end to the low-pressure end. Likewise, a positive charge that is free to move will move from a region with high potential to a region with lower potential.

## Electric Animals
Many animals generate and/or detect electric fields. This is useful for activities such as hunting, defense, navigation, communication, and mating. Because salt water is a relatively good conductor, electric fish have evolved in all the world’s oceans. These fish have intrigued humans since the earliest times. In the nineteenth century, parties were even organized where the main attraction was getting a jolt from an electric fish! Scientists also studied electric fish to learn about electricity. Alessandro Volta based his research that led to batteries in 1799 on electric fish. He even referred to batteries as artificial electric organs, because he saw them as imitations of the electric organs of electric fish.

Animals that generate electricity are called *electrogenic* and those that detect electric fields are called *electroreceptive*. Most fish that are electrogenic are also electroreceptive. One of the most well-known electric fish is the electric eel (see [Figure 18 04 eleceel](Figure_18_04_eleceel)), which is both electrogenic and electroreceptive. These fish have three pairs of organs that produce the electric charge: the main organ, Hunter’s organ, and Sach’s organ. Together, these organs account for more than 80percent of the fish’s body.

Electric eels can produce electric discharges of much greater voltage than what you would get from a standard wall socket. These discharges can stun or even kill their prey. They also use low-intensity discharges to navigate. The electric fields they generate reflect off nearby obstacles or animals and are then detected by electroreceptors in the eel’s skin. The three organs that produce electricity contain electrolytes, which are substances that ionize when dissolved in water (or other liquids). An ionized atom or molecule is one that has lost or gained at least one electron, so it carries a net charge. Thus, a liquid solution containing an electrolyte conducts electricity, because the ions in the solution can move if an electric field is applied.

To produce large discharges, the main organ is used. It contains approximately 6,000 rows of electroplaques connected in a long chain. Connected this way, the voltage between electroplaques adds up, creating a large final voltage. Each electroplaque consists of a column of cells controlled by an excitor nerve. When triggered by the excitor nerve, the electroplaques allow ionized sodium to flow through them, creating a potential difference between electroplaques. These potentials add up, and a large current can flow through the electrolyte.

This geometry is reflected in batteries, which also use stacks of plates to produce larger potential differences.

## X-ray Tube
Dentists use X-rays to image their patients’ teeth and bones. The X-ray tubes that generate X-rays contain an electron source separated by about 10 cm from a metallic target. The electrons are accelerated from the source to the target by a uniform electric field with a magnitude of about 100 kN/C, as drawn in [Figure 18 04 x-raytube](Figure_18_04_x-raytube). When the electrons hit the target, X-rays are produced. (a) What is the potential difference between the electron source and the metallic target? (b) What is the kinetic energy of the electrons when they reach the target, assuming that the electrons start at rest?

![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_18_04_x-raytube.jpg)<p>In an X-ray tube, a large current flows through the electron source, causing electrons to be ejected from the electron source. The ejected electrons are accelerated toward the target by the electric field. When they strike the target, X-rays are produced.</p>

## Discussion for (a)
The potential difference is positive, so the energy per unit positive charge is higher at the target than at the source. This means that free positive charges would fall from the target to the source. However, electrons are negative charges, so they accelerate from the source toward the target, gaining kinetic energy as they go.

## Strategy FOR (B)
Apply conservation of energy to find the final kinetic energy of the electrons. In going from the source to the target, the change in electric potential energy plus the change in kinetic energy of the electrons must be zero, so  <math> <mrow>  <mi>Δ</mi><msub>   <mi>U</mi>   <mi>E</mi>  </msub>  <mo>+</mo><mi>Δ</mi><mi>K</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><mtext>.</mtext></math>  The change in electric potential energy for moving through a constant electric field is given by the equation  The change in electric potential energy for moving through a constant electric field is given by the equation

## Electric Potential Energy of Doorknob and Dust Speck
Consider again the doorknob from the example in the previous section. The doorknob is treated as a spherical conductor with a uniform static charge  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>q</mi>   <mn>1</mn>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo><mn>−1.5</mn><mspace width="0.3em" /><mtext>nC</mtext></mrow></math>  on its surface.

## Strategy
As we did in the previous section, we treat the charge as if it were concentrated at the center of the doorknob. Again, as you will be able to validate in later physics classes, we can make this simplification, because the charge is uniformly distributed over the surface of the spherical object. Make a sketch of the situation and define a coordinate system, as shown in the image below. We use  <math> <mrow>  <mo>+</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></math>  to indicate the outward direction perpendicular to the door, with    to indicate the outward direction perpendicular to the door, with  <math> <mrow>  <mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math>  at the center of the doorknob.

## Discussion
The energy is negative, which means that the energy will decrease that is, get even *more* negative as the speck of dust approaches the doorknob. This helps explain why dust accumulates on objects that carry a static charge. However, note that insulators normally collect more static charge than conductors, because any charge that accumulates on insulators cannot move about on the insulator to find a way to escape. They must simply wait to be removed by some passing moist speck of dust or other host.

### Check Your Understanding

Gravitational potential energy is the potential for two masses to do work by virtue of their positions with respect to each other. What is the analogous definition of electric potential energy?

1. Electric potential energy is the potential for two charges to do work by virtue of their positions with respect to the origin point.
2. Electric potential energy is the potential for two charges to do work by virtue of their positions with respect to infinity.
3. Electric potential energy is the potential for two charges to do work by virtue of their positions with respect to each other.
4. Electric potential energy is the potential for single charges to do work by virtue of their positions with respect to their final positions.

A negative charge is 10 m from a positive charge. Where would you have to move the negative charge to increase the potential energy of the system?

1. The negative charge should be moved closer to the positive charge.
2. The negative charge should be moved farther away from the positive charge.
3. The negative charge should be moved to infinity.
4. The negative charge should be placed just next to the positive charge.



### Section Summary

* Electric potential energy is a concept similar to gravitational potential energy: It is the potential that charges have to do work by virtue of their positions relative to each other.
* Electric potential is the electric potential energy per unit charge.
* The potential is always measured between two points, where one point may be at infinity.
* Positive charges move from regions of high potential to regions of low potential.
* Negative charges move from regions of low potential to regions of high potential.
