### Scientific Experiments and Problems

Relativity is not new. Way back around the year 1600, Galileo explained that motion is relative. Wherever you happen to be, it seems like you are at a fixed point and that everything moves with respect to you. Everyone else feels the same way. Motion is always measured with respect to a fixed point. This is called establishing a **frame of reference**. But the choice of the point is arbitrary, and all frames of reference are equally valid. A passenger in a moving car is not moving with respect to the driver, but they are both moving from the point of view of a person on the sidewalk waiting for a bus. They are moving even faster as seen by a person in a car coming toward them. It is all relative.

A frame of reference is not a complicated concept. It is just something you decide is a fixed point or group of connected points. It is completely up to you. For example, when you look up at celestial objects in the sky, you choose the earth as your frame of reference, and the sun, moon, etc., seem to move across the sky.

Light is involved in the discussion of relativity because theories related to electromagnetism are inconsistent with Galileo’s and Newton’s explanation of relativity. The true nature of light was a hot topic of discussion and controversy in the late 19th century. At the time, it was not generally believed that light could travel across empty space. It was known to travel as waves, and all other types of energy that propagated as waves needed to travel though a material medium. It was believed that space was filled with an invisible medium that light waves traveled through. This imaginary (as it turned out) material was called the **ether** (also spelled aether). It was thought that everything moved through this mysterious fluid. In other words, ether was the one fixed frame of reference. The **Michelson–Morley experiment** proved it was not.

In 1887, Albert Michelson and Edward Morley designed the interferometer shown in [Figure 10 01 mirror](Figure_10_01_mirror) to measure the speed of Earth through the ether. A light beam is split into two perpendicular paths and then recombined. Recombining the waves produces an inference pattern, with a bright fringe at the locations where the two waves arrive in phase; that is, with the crests of both waves arriving together and the troughs arriving together. A dark fringe appears where the crest of one wave coincides with a trough of the other, so that the two cancel. If Earth is traveling through the ether as it orbits the sun, the peaks in one arm would take longer than in the other to reach the same location. The places where the two waves arrive in phase would change, and the interference pattern would shift. But, using the interferometer, there was no shift seen! This result led to two conclusions: that there is no ether and that the speed of light is the same regardless of the relative motion of source and observer. The Michelson–Morley investigation has been called the most famous failed experiment in history.

To see what Michelson and Morley expected to find when they measured the speed of light in two directions, watch [temporarily unnamed link](). In the video, two people swimming in a lake are represented as an analogy to light beams leaving Earth as it moves through the ether (if there were any ether). The swimmers swim away from and back to a platform that is moving through the water. The swimmers swim in different directions with respect to the motion of the platform. Even though they swim equal distances at the same speed, the motion of the platform causes them to arrive at different times.



### Einstein’s Postulates

The results described above left physicists with some puzzling and unsettling questions such as, why doesn’t light emitted by a fast-moving object travel faster than light from a street lamp? A radical new theory was needed, and Albert Einstein, shown in [Figure 10 01 Einstein](Figure_10_01_Einstein), was about to become everyone’s favorite genius. Einstein began with two simple **postulates** based on the two things we have discussed so far in this chapter. 

1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.
2. The speed of light is the same in all inertial reference frames and is not affected by the speed of its source. 


        <caption>Albert Einstein (1879–1955) developed modern relativity and also made fundamental contributions to the foundations of quantum mechanics. (The Library of Congress)</caption>
The speed of light is given the symbol *c* and is equal to exactly 299,792,458 m/s. This is the speed of light in vacuum; that is, in the absence of air. For most purposes, we round this number off to  <math>      <mrow>        <mn>3.00</mn><mspace width="0.25em" /><mo>×</mo><mspace width="0.25em" /><msup>          <mrow>            <mn>10</mn>          </mrow>          <mn>8</mn>        </msup>        <mtext> m/s</mtext>      </mrow>    </math>  The term   The term **inertial reference frame** simply refers to a frame of reference where all objects follow Newton’s first law of motion: Objects at rest remain at rest, and objects in motion remain in motion at a constant velocity in a straight line, unless acted upon by an external force. The inside of a car moving along a road at constant velocity and the inside of a stationary house are inertial reference frames.

## The Speed of Light
This lecture on light summarizes the most important facts about the speed of light. If you are interested, you can watch the whole video, but the parts relevant to this chapter are found between 3:25 and 5:10, which you find by running your cursor along the bottom of the video.


        An airliner traveling at 200 m/s emits light from the front of the plane. Which statement describes the speed of the light?

1. It travels at a speed of *c* + 200 m/s.
2. It travels at a speed of *c*  200 m/s.
3. It travels at a speed *c*, like all light.
4. It travels at a speed slightly less than *c*.

> ## Measure the Speed of Light
> In this experiment, you will measure the speed of light using a microwave oven and a slice of bread. The waves generated by a microwave oven are not part of the visible spectrum, but they are still electromagnetic radiation, so they travel at the speed of light. If we know the wavelength, *λ*, and frequency, *f*, of a wave, we can calculate its speed, *v*, using the equation *v = λf*. You can measure the wavelength. You will find the frequency on a label on the back of a microwave oven. The wave in a microwave is a standing wave with areas of high and low intensity. The high intensity sections are one-half wavelength apart.

> 4. A row of brown or black marks should appear on the bread. Stop the microwave as soon as they appear. Measure the distance between two adjacent burn marks and multiply the result by 2. This is the wavelength.
> 5. The frequency of the waves is written on the back of the microwave. Look for something like “2,450 MHz.” Hz is the unit hertz, which means *per second*. The M represents mega, which stands for million, so multiply the number by 10<sup>6</sup>.
> 6. Express the wavelength in meters and multiply it times the frequency. If you did everything correctly, you will get a number very close to the speed of light. Do not eat the bread. It is a general laboratory safety rule never to eat anything in the lab.
> 
> How does your measured value of the speed of light compare to the accepted value (% error)?
> 
> 1. The measured value of speed will be equal to *c*.
> 2. The measured value of speed will be slightly less than *c*.
> 3. The measured value of speed will be slightly greater than *c*.

Einstein’s postulates were carefully chosen, and they both seemed very likely to be true. Einstein proceeded despite realizing that these two ideas taken together and applied to extreme conditions led to results that contradict Newtonian mechanics. He just took the ball and ran with it. 

In the traditional view, velocities are additive. If you are running at 3 m/s and you throw a ball forward at a speed of 10 m/s, the ball should have a net speed of 13 m/s. However, according to relativity theory, the speed of a moving light source is not added to the speed of the emitted light.

In addition, Einstein’s theory shows that if you were moving forward relative to Earth at nearly *c* (the speed of light) and could throw a ball forward at *c*, an observer at rest on the earth would not see the ball moving at nearly twice the speed of light. The observer would see it moving at a speed that is still less than *c*. This result conforms to both of Einstein’s postulates: The speed of light has a fixed maximum and neither reference frame is privileged.

Consider how we measure elapsed time. If we use a stopwatch, for example, how do we know when to start and stop the watch? One method is to use the arrival of light from the event, such as observing a light turn green to start a drag race. The timing will be more accurate if some sort of electronic detection is used, avoiding human reaction times and other complications.

Now suppose we use this method to measure the time interval between two flashes of light produced by flash lamps on a moving train. (See [Figure 10 01 train](Figure_10_01_train)) 


        <caption>Light arriving to observer A as seen by two different observers.</caption>
A woman (observer A) is seated in the center of a rail car, with two flash lamps at opposite sides equidistant from her. Multiple light rays that are emitted from the flash lamps move towards observer A, as shown with arrows. A velocity vector arrow for the rail car is shown towards the right. A man (observer B) standing on the platform is facing the woman and also observes the flashes of light.

Observer A moves with the lamps on the rail car as the rail car moves towards the right of observer B. Observer B receives the light flashes simultaneously, and sees the bulbs as both having flashed at the same time. However, he sees observer A receive the flash from the right first. Because the pulse from the right reaches her first, in her frame of reference she sees the bulbs as not having flashed simultaneously. Here, a relative velocity between observers affects whether two events at well-separated locations are observed to be simultaneous. **Simultaneity**, or whether different events occur at the same instant, depends on the frame of reference of the observer. Remember that velocity equals distance divided by time, so *t = d/**v*. If velocity appears to be different, then duration of time appears to be different. 

This illustrates the power of clear thinking. We might have guessed incorrectly that, if light is emitted simultaneously, then two observers halfway between the sources would see the flashes simultaneously. But careful analysis shows this not to be the case. Einstein was brilliant at this type of thought experiment (in German, *Gedankenexperiment*). He very carefully considered how an observation is made and disregarded what might seem obvious. The validity of thought experiments, of course, is determined by actual observation. The genius of Einstein is evidenced by the fact that experiments have repeatedly confirmed his theory of relativity. No experiments after that of Michelson and Morley were able to detect any ether medium. We will describe later how experiments also confirmed other predictions of **special relativity**, such as the distance between two objects and the time interval of two events being different for two observers moving with respect to each other. 

In summary: Two events are defined to be simultaneous if an observer measures them as occurring at the same time (such as by receiving light from the events). Two events are not necessarily simultaneous to all observers.

The discrepancies between Newtonian mechanics and relativity theory illustrate an important point about how science advances. Einstein’s theory did not replace Newton’s but rather extended it. It is not unusual that a new theory must be developed to account for new information. In most cases, the new theory is built on the foundation of older theory. It is rare that old theories are completely replaced.

In this chapter, you will learn about the theory of special relativity, but, as mentioned in the introduction, Einstein developed two relativity theories: special and general. [Table 10 01 relativity](Table_10_01_relativity) summarizes the differences between the two theories.

## Discussion
The answer is written as 5.00 × 10<sup>2</sup> rather than 500 in order to show that there are three significant figures. When astronomers witness an event on the sun, such as a sunspot, it actually happened minutes earlier. Compare 8 light *minutes* to the distance to stars, which are light *years* away. Any events on other stars happened years ago.

### Critical Thinking

Explain how the two postulates of Einsteins theory of special relativity, when taken together, could lead to a situation that seems to contradict the mechanics and laws of motion as described by Newton.

1. In Newtonian mechanics, velocities are multiplicative but the speed of a moving light source cannot be multiplied to the speed of light because, according to special relativity, the speed of light is the maximum speed possible.
2. In Newtonian mechanics, velocities are additive but the speed of a moving light source cannot be added to the speed of light because the speed of light is the maximum speed possible.
3. An object that is at rest in one frame of reference may appear to be in motion in another frame of reference, while in Newtonian mechanics such a situation is not possible.
4. The postulates of Einsteins theory of special relativity do not contradict any situation that Newtonian mechanics explains.

### Test Prep Extended Response

Explain how Einstein’s conclusion that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light contradicts an older concept about the speed of an object propelled from another, already moving, object.

1. The older concept is that speeds are subtractive. For example, if a person throws a ball while running, the speed of the ball relative to the ground is the speed at which the person was running minus the speed of the throw. A relativistic example is when light is emitted from car headlights, it moves faster than the speed of light emitted from a stationary source.
2. The older concept is that speeds are additive. For example, if a person throws a ball while running, the speed of the ball relative to the ground is the speed at which the person was running plus the speed of the throw. A relativistic example is when light is emitted from car headlights, it moves no faster than the speed of light emitted from a stationary source. The car's speed does not affect the speed of light.
3. The older concept is that speeds are multiplicative. For example, if a person throws a ball while running, the speed of the ball relative to the ground is the speed at which the person was running multiplied by the speed of the throw. A relativistic example is when light is emitted from car
headlights, it moves no faster than the speed of light emitted from a stationary source. The car's speed does not affect the speed of light.
4. The older concept is that speeds are frame independent. For example, if a person throws a ball while running, the speed of the ball relative to the ground has nothing to do with the speed at which the person was running. A relativistic example is when light is emitted from car headlights, it
moves no faster than the speed of light emitted from a stationary source. The car's speed does not affect the speed of light.

A rowboat is drifting downstream. One person swims 20 m toward the shore and back, and another, leaving at the same time, swims upstream 20 m and back to the boat. The swimmer who swam toward the shore gets back first. Explain how this outcome is similar to the outcome expected in the MichelsonMorley experiment.

1. The rowboat represents Earth, the swimmers are beams of light, and the water is acting as the ether. Light going against the current of the ether would get back later because, by then, Earth would have moved on.
2. The rowboat represents the beam of light, the swimmers are the ether, and water is acting as Earth. Light going against the current of the ether would get back later because, by then, Earth would have moved on.
3. The rowboat represents the ether, the swimmers are ray of light, and the water is acting as the earth. Light going against the current of the ether would get back later because, by then, Earth would have moved on.
4. The rowboat represents the Earth, the swimmers are the ether, and the water is acting as the rays of light. Light going against the current of the ether would get back later because, by then, Earth would have moved on.
