More than 100 years before Thomson and Rutherford discovered the fundamental particles that carry positive and negative electric charges, the French scientist Charles-Augustin de **Coulomb** mathematically described the force between charged objects. Doing so required careful measurements of forces between charged spheres, for which he built an ingenious device called a ****.

This device, shown in [None](None), contains an insulating rod that is hanging by a thread inside a glass-walled enclosure. At one end of the rod is the metallic sphere A. When no charge is on this sphere, it touches sphere B. Coulomb would touch the spheres with a third metallic ball (shown at the bottom of the diagram) that was charged. An unknown amount of charge would distribute evenly between spheres A and B, which would then repel each other, because like charges repel. This force would cause sphere A to rotate away from sphere B, thus twisting the wire until the torsion in the wire balanced the electrical force. Coulomb then turned the knob at the top, which allowed him to rotate the thread, thus bringing sphere A closer to sphere B. He found that bringing sphere A twice as close to sphere B required increasing the torsion by a factor of four. Bringing the sphere three times closer required a ninefold increase in the torsion. From this type of measurement, he deduced that the electrical force between the spheres was inversely proportional to the distance squared between the spheres. In other words,

F∝1r2,where *r* is the distance between the spheres.

An **electrical charge** distributes itself equally between two conducting spheres of the same size. Knowing this allowed Coulomb to divide an unknown charge in half. Repeating this process would produce a sphere with one quarter of the initial charge, and so on. Using this technique, he measured the force between spheres A and B when they were charged with different amounts of charge. These measurements led him to deduce that the force was proportional to the charge on each sphere, or

F∝qAqB,where  qA  is the charge on sphere A, and  qB  is the charge on sphere B.

Combining these two proportionalities, he proposed the following expression to describe the force between the charged spheres.

F=kq1q2r2This equation is known as **Coulomb’s law**, and it describes the electrostatic force between charged objects. The constant of proportionality *k* is called ****. In SI units, the constant *k* has the value  k=8.99×109N⋅m2/C2. 

The direction of the force is along the line joining the centers of the two objects. If the two charges are of opposite signs, Coulomb’s law gives a negative result. This means that the force between the particles is attractive. If the two charges have the same signs, Coulomb’s law gives a positive result. This means that the force between the particles is repulsive. For example, if both  q1  and  q2  are negative or if both are positive, the force between them is repulsive. This is shown in [None](None)(a). If  q1  is a negative charge and  q2  is a positive charge (or vice versa), then the charges are different, so the force between them is attractive. This is shown in [None](None)(b).


<caption>The magnitude of the electrostatic force </caption>
Note that Coulomb’s law applies only to charged objects that are not moving with respect to each other. The law says that the force is proportional to the amount of charge on each object and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. If we double the charge  q1, for instance, then the force is doubled. If we double the distance between the objects, then the force between them *decreases* by a factor of  22=4 . Although Coulomb’s law is true in general, it is easiest to apply to spherical objects or to objects that are much smaller than the distance between the objects (in which case, the objects can be approximated as spheres).

Coulomb’s law is an example of an **inverse-square law**, which means the force depends on the square of the denominator. Another inverse-square law is Newton’s law of universal gravitation, which is  F=Gm1m2/r2 . Although these laws are similar, they differ in two important respects: (i) The gravitational constant *G* is much, much smaller than *k* ( G=6.67×10−11m3/kg⋅s2 ); and (ii) only one type of mass exists, whereas two types of electric charge exist. These two differences explain why gravity is so much weaker than the electrostatic force and why gravity is only attractive, whereas the electrostatic force can be attractive or repulsive.

Finally, note that Coulomb measured the distance between the spheres from the centers of each sphere. He did not explain this assumption in his original papers, but it turns out to be valid. From *outside* a uniform spherical distribution of charge, it can be treated as if all the charge were located at the center of the sphere.

## Electrostatics (part 1): Introduction to charge and Coulomb's law
This video explains the basics of Coulomb’s law. Note that the lecturer uses *d* for the distance between the center of the particles instead of *r*.

## Using Coulomb’s law to find the force between charged objects
Suppose Coulomb measures a force of  20×10−6N  between the two charged spheres when they are separated by 5.0 cm. By turning the dial at the top of the torsion balance, he approaches the spheres so that they are separated by 3.0 cm. Which force does he measure now?

## Strategy
Apply Coulomb’s law to the situation before and after the spheres are brought closer together. Although we do not know the charges on the spheres, we do know that they remain the same. We call these unknown but constant charges  q1  and  q2 . Because these charges appear as a product in Coulomb’s law, they form a single unknown. We thus have two equations and two unknowns, which we can solve. The first unknown is the force (which we call  Ff ) when the spheres are 3.0 cm apart, and the second is  q1q2 .

Use the following notation: When the charges are 5.0 cm apart, the force is  Fi=20×10−6N  and  ri=5.0cm=0.050m, where the subscript *i* means *initial*. Once the charges are brought closer together, we know  rf=3.0cm=0.030m, where the subscript *f* means *final*.

## Solution
Coulomb’s law applied to the spheres in their initial positions gives

Fi=kq1q2ri2..Coulomb’s law applied to the spheres in their final positions gives

Ff=kq1q2rf2..Dividing the second equation by the first and solving for the final force  Ff  leads to

FfFi=kq1q2/rf2kq1q2/ri2.
     =ri2rf2Ff=Firi2rf2.Inserting the known quantities yields

Ff=Firi2rf2
     =(20×10−6N)(0.050m)2(0.030m)2
     =56×10−6N
     =5.6×10−5N.The force acts along the line joining the centers of the spheres. Because the same type of charge is on each sphere, the force is repulsive.

## Discussion
As expected, the force between the charges is greater when they are 3.0 cm apart than when they are 5.0 cm apart. Note that although it is a good habit to convert cm to m (because the constant *k* is in SI units), it is not necessary in this problem, because the distances cancel out.

We can also solve for the second unknown  |q1q2| . By using the first equation, we find

Ff=kq1q2ri2q1q2=Firi2k
     =(20×10−6N)(0.050m)28.99×109N⋅m2/C2
     =5.6×10−18C2Note how the units cancel in the second-to-last line. Had we not converted cm to m, this would not occur, and the result would be incorrect. Finally, because the charge on each sphere is the same, we can further deduce that

q1=q2=±5.6×10−18C2=±2.4nC.## Using Coulomb’s law to find the distance between charged objects
An engineer measures the force between two ink drops by measuring their acceleration and their diameter. She finds that each member of a pair of ink drops exerts a repulsive force of  F=5.5mN  on its partner. If each ink drop carries a charge  qinkdrop=−1×10−10C, how far apart are the ink drops?

## Strategy
We know the force and the charge on each ink drop, so we can solve Coulomb’s law for the distance *r* between the ink drops. Do not forget to convert the force into SI units:  F=5.5mN=5.5×10−3N. 

## Solution
The charges in Coulomb’s law are  q1=q2=qinkdrop,  so the numerator in Coulomb’s law takes the form  q1q2=qinkdrop2 . Inserting this into Coulomb’s law and solving for the distance *r* gives

F=kqinkdrop2r2r=±kqinkdrop2F
     =±(8.99×109N⋅m2/C2)(−1×10−10C)25.5×10−3N
     =±1.3×10−4mor 130 microns (about one-tenth of a millimeter).

## Discussion
The plus-minus sign means that we do not know which ink drop is to the right and which is to the left, but that is not important, because both ink drops are the same.
