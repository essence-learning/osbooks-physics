### Concepts Related to Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation

Sir Isaac Newton was the first scientist to precisely define the gravitational force, and to show that it could explain both falling bodies and astronomical motions. See [None](None). But Newton was not the first to suspect that the same force caused both our weight and the motion of planets. His forerunner, Galileo Galilei, had contended that falling bodies and planetary motions had the same cause. Some of Newton’s contemporaries, such as Robert Hooke, Christopher Wren, and Edmund Halley, had also made some progress toward understanding gravitation. But Newton was the first to propose an exact mathematical form and to use that form to show that the motion of heavenly bodies should be conic sections—circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas. This theoretical prediction was a major triumph. It had been known for some time that moons, planets, and comets follow such paths, but no one had been able to propose an explanation of the mechanism that caused them to follow these paths and not others.


<caption>The popular legend that Newton suddenly discovered the law of universal gravitation when an apple fell from a tree and hit him on the head has an element of truth in it. A more probable account is that he was walking through an orchard and wondered why all the apples fell in the same direction with the same acceleration. Great importance is attached to it because Newton’s universal law of gravitation and his laws of motion answered very old questions about nature and gave tremendous support to the notion of underlying simplicity and unity in nature. Scientists still expect underlying simplicity to emerge from their ongoing inquiries into nature.</caption>
The gravitational force is relatively simple. It is always attractive, and it depends only on the masses involved and the distance between them. Expressed in modern language, **Newton’s universal law of gravitation** states that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force that is directed along a line joining them. The force is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This attraction is illustrated by [None](None).


<caption>Gravitational attraction is along a line joining the centers of mass (CM) of the two bodies. The magnitude of the force on each body is the same, consistent with Newton’s third law (action-reaction).</caption>
For two bodies having masses *m* and *M* with a distance *r* between their centers of mass, the equation for Newton’s universal law of gravitation is

F=GmMr2where *F* is the magnitude of the gravitational force and *G* is a proportionality factor called the **gravitational constant**. *G* is a universal constant, meaning that it is thought to be the same everywhere in the universe. It has been measured experimentally to be  G=6.673×10−11N⋅m2/kg2 .

If a person has a mass of 60.0 kg, what would be the force of gravitational attraction on him at Earth’s surface? *G* is given above, Earth’s mass *M* is 5.97 × 10<sup>24</sup> kg, and the radius *r* of Earth is 6.38 × 10<sup>6</sup> m. Putting these values into Newton’s universal law of gravitation gives

F=GmMr2=(6.673×10−11N⋅m2kg2)((60.0 kg)(5.97×1024 kg)(6.38×106 m)2)=584 NWe can check this result with the relationship:  F=mg=(60kg)(9.8m/s2)=588N 

You may remember that *g*, the acceleration due to gravity, is another important constant related to gravity. By substituting *g* for *a* in the equation for Newton’s second law of motion we get  F=mg . Combining this with the equation for universal gravitation gives

mg=GmMr2Cancelling the mass *m* on both sides of the equation and filling in the values for the gravitational constant and mass and radius of the Earth, gives the value of *g, *which may look familiar.

g=GMr2=(6.67×10−11N⋅m2kg2)(5.98×1024kg(6.38×106m)2)=9.80m/s2This is a good point to recall the difference between mass and weight. Mass is the amount of matter in an object; weight is the force of attraction between the mass within two objects. Weight can change because *g* is different on every moon and planet. An object’s mass *m* does not change but its weight *m**g* can.

It is possible to derive Kepler’s third law from Newton’s law of universal gravitation. Applying Newton’s second law of motion to angular motion gives an expression for centripetal force, which can be equated to the expression for force in the universal gravitation equation. This expression can be manipulated to produce the equation for Kepler’s third law. We saw earlier that the expression *r* is a constant for satellites orbiting the same massive object. The derivation of Kepler’s third law from Newton’s law of universal gravitation and Newton’s second law of motion yields that constant:

r3T2=GM4π2where *M* is the mass of the central body about which the satellites orbit (for example, the sun in our solar system). The usefulness of this equation will be seen later.

The universal gravitational constant *G *is determined experimentally. This determination was first done accurately in 1798 by English scientist Henry Cavendish (1731–1810), more than 100 years after Newton published his universal law of gravitation. The measurement of *G *is very basic and important because it determines the strength of one of the four forces in nature. Cavendish’s experiment was very difficult because he measured the tiny gravitational attraction between two ordinary-sized masses (tens of kilograms at most) by using an apparatus like that in [None](None). Remarkably, his value for *G *differs by less than 1% from the modern value.


<caption>Cavendish used an apparatus like this to measure the gravitational attraction between two suspended spheres (</caption>
### Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity

Einstein’s theory of general relativity explained some interesting properties of gravity not covered by Newton’s theory. Einstein based his theory on the postulate that acceleration and gravity have the same effect and cannot be distinguished from each other. He concluded that light must fall in both a gravitational field and in an accelerating reference frame. [None](None) shows this effect (greatly exaggerated) in an accelerating elevator. In [None](None) *(a)*, the elevator accelerates upward in zero gravity. In [None](None) *(b)*, the room is not accelerating but is subject to gravity. The effect on light is the same: it “falls” downward in both situations. The person in the elevator cannot tell whether the elevator is accelerating in zero gravity or is stationary and subject to gravity. Thus, gravity affects the path of light, even though we think of gravity as acting between masses, while photons are massless.


<caption>(a) A beam of light emerges from a flashlight in an upward-accelerating elevator. Since the elevator moves up during the time the light takes to reach the wall, the beam strikes lower than it would if the elevator were not accelerated. (b) Gravity must have the same effect on light, since it is not possible to tell whether the elevator is accelerating upward or is stationary and acted upon by gravity.</caption>
Einstein’s theory of general relativity got its first verification in 1919 when starlight passing near the sun was observed during a solar eclipse. (See [None](None).) During an eclipse, the sky is darkened and we can briefly see stars. Those on a line of sight nearest the sun should have a shift in their apparent positions. Not only was this shift observed, but it agreed with Einstein’s predictions well within experimental uncertainties. This discovery created a scientific and public sensation. Einstein was now a folk hero as well as a very great scientist. The bending of light by matter is equivalent to a bending of space itself, with light following the curve. This is another radical change in our concept of space and time. It is also another connection that any particle with mass *or* energy (e.g., massless photons) is affected by gravity.


<caption>This schematic shows how light passing near a massive body like the sun is curved toward it. The light that reaches the Earth then seems to be coming from different locations than the known positions of the originating stars. Not only was this effect observed, but the amount of bending was precisely what Einstein predicted in his general theory of relativity.</caption>
To summarize the two views of gravity, Newton envisioned gravity as a tug of war along the line connecting any two objects in the universe. In contrast, Einstein envisioned gravity as a bending of space-time by mass.

## NASA gravity probe B
NASA’s Gravity Probe B (GP-B) mission has confirmed two key predictions derived from Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity. The probe, shown in [None](None) was launched in 2004. It carried four ultra-precise gyroscopes designed to measure two effects hypothesized by Einstein’s theory:

* **geodetic effect**
* **frame-dragging effect**


<caption>Artist concept of Gravity Probe B spacecraft in orbit around the Earth. (credit: NASA/MSFC)</caption>
Both effects were measured with unprecedented precision. This was done by pointing the gyroscopes at a single star while orbiting Earth in a polar orbit. As predicted by relativity theory, the gyroscopes experienced very small, but measureable, changes in the direction of their spin caused by the pull of Earth’s gravity.

The principle investigator suggested imagining Earth spinning in honey. As Earth rotates it drags space and time with it as it would a surrounding sea of honey.

### Calculations Based on Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation

When performing calculations using the equations in this chapter, use units of kilograms for mass, meters for distances, newtons for force, and seconds for time.

The mass of an object is constant, but its weight varies with the strength of the gravitational field. This means the value of *g* varies from place to place in the universe. The relationship between force, mass, and acceleration from the second law of motion can be written in terms of *g*.

F=ma=mgIn this case, the force is the weight of the object, which is caused by the gravitational attraction of the planet or moon on which the object is located. We can use this expression to compare weights of an object on different moons and planets.

## Mass and Weight Clarification
This video shows the mathematical basis of the relationship between mass and weight. The distinction between mass and weight are clearly explained. The mathematical relationship between mass and weight are shown mathematically in terms of the equation for Newton’s law of universal gravitation and in terms of his second law of motion.



Would you have the same mass on the moon as you do on Earth? Would you have the same weight?

1. You would weigh more on the moon than on Earth because gravity on the moon is stronger than gravity on Earth.
2. You would weigh less on the moon than on Earth because gravity on the moon is weaker than gravity on Earth.
3. You would weigh less on the moon than on Earth because gravity on the moon is stronger than gravity on Earth.
4. You would weigh more on the moon than on Earth because gravity on the moon is weaker than gravity on Earth.

Two equations involving the gravitational constant, *G*, are often useful. The first is Newton’s equation,  F=GmMr2 . Several of the values in this equation are either constants or easily obtainable. *F* is often the weight of an object on the surface of a large object with mass *M*, which is usually known. The mass of the smaller object, *m*, is often known, and *G* is a universal constant with the same value anywhere in the universe. This equation can be used to solve problems involving an object on or orbiting Earth or other massive celestial object. Sometimes it is helpful to equate the right-hand side of the equation to *m**g* and cancel the *m* on both sides.

The equation  r3T2=GM4π2  is also useful for problems involving objects in orbit. Note that there is no need to know the mass of the object. Often, we know the radius *r* or the period *T* and want to find the other. If these are both known, we can use the equation to calculate the mass of a planet or star.

## Change in 
The value of *g* on the planet Mars is 3.71 m/s<sup>2</sup>. If you have a mass of 60.0 kg on Earth, what would be your mass on Mars? What would be your weight on Mars?

## Strategy
Weight equals acceleration due to gravity times mass:  W=mg . An object’s mass is constant. Call acceleration due to gravity on Mars *g**None* and weight on Mars *W**None*.

## Solution
Mass on Mars would be the same, 60 kg.

WM=mgM=(60.0kg)(3.71m/s2)=223N## Discussion
The value of *g* on any planet depends on the mass of the planet and the distance from its center. If the material below the surface varies from point to point, the value of *g* will also vary slightly.

## Earth’s g at the Moon
Find the acceleration due to Earth’s gravity at the distance of the moon.

G = 6.67 × 10–11 N · m2 /kg2Earth-moon distance = 3.84 × 108 mEarth’s mass = 5.98 × 1024 kgExpress the force of gravity in terms of *g*.

F = W = ma = mgCombine with the equation for universal gravitation.

mg=mGMr2## Solution
Cancel *m* and substitute.

g=GMr2=(6.67×10−11N⋅m2kg2)(5.98×1024 kg(3.84×108 m)2)=2.70×10−3m/s2## Discussion
The value of *g* for the moon is 1.62 m/s<sup>2</sup>. Comparing this value to the answer, we see that Earth’s gravitational influence on an object on the moon’s surface would be insignificant.

### Performance Task

Design an experiment to test whether magnetic force is inversely proportional to the square of distance. Gravitational, magnetic, and electrical fields all act at a distance, but do they all follow the inverse square law? One difference in the forces related to these fields is that gravity is only attractive, but the other two can repel as well. In general, the inverse square law says that force *F* equals a constant *C* divided by the distance between objects, *d*, squared:  F=C/d2 .

Incorporate these materials into your design:
* Two strong, permanent bar magnets
* A spring scale that can measure small forces
* A short ruler calibrated in millimeters



Use the magnets to study the relationship between attractive force and distance.

### Test Prep Short Answer

Newtons third law of motion says that, for every action force, there is a reaction force equal in magnitude but that acts in the opposite direction. Apply this law to gravitational forces acting between the Washington Monument and Earth.

1. The monument is attracted to Earth with a force equal to its weight, and Earth is attracted to the monument with a force equal to Earths weight. The situation can be represented with two force vectors of unequal magnitude and pointing in the same direction.
2. The monument is attracted to Earth with a force equal to its weight, and Earth is attracted to the monument with a force equal to Earths weight. The situation can be represented with two force vectors of unequal magnitude but pointing in opposite directions.
3. The monument is attracted to Earth with a force equal to its weight, and Earth is attracted to the monument with an equal force. The situation can be represented with two force vectors of equal magnitude and pointing in the same direction.
4. The monument is attracted to Earth with a force equal to its weight, and Earth is attracted to the monument with an equal force. The situation can be represented with two force vectors of equal magnitude but pointing in opposite directions.

True or false—Gravitational force is the attraction of the mass of one object to the mass of another. Light, either as a particle or a wave, has no rest mass. Despite this fact gravity bends a beam of light.

### Test Prep Extended Response


It took scientists a long time to arrive at the understanding of gravity as explained by Galileo and Newton. They were hindered by two ideas that
seemed like common sense but were serious misconceptions. First was the fact that heavier things fall faster than light things. Second, it was
believed impossible that forces could act at a distance. Explain why these ideas persisted and why they prevented advances.


1. Heavier things fall faster than light things if they have less surface area and greater mass density. In the Renaissance and before, forces that
acted at a distance were considered impossible, so people were skeptical about scientific theories that invoked such forces.
2. Heavier things fall faster than light things because they have greater surface area and less mass density. In the Renaissance and before, forces that
act at a distance were considered impossible, so people were skeptical about scientific theories that invoked such forces.
3. Heavier things fall faster than light things because they have less surface area and greater mass density. In the Renaissance and before, forces that
act at a distance were considered impossible, so people were quick to accept scientific theories that invoked such forces.
4. Heavier things fall faster than light things because they have larger surface area and less mass density. In the Renaissance and before, forces that act
at a distance were considered impossible because of people’s faith in scientific theories.
