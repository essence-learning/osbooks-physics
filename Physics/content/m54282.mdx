### Relativistic Effects on Time, Distance, and Momentum

Consideration of the measurement of elapsed time and simultaneity leads to an important relativistic effect. **Time dilation** is the phenomenon of time passing more slowly for an observer who is moving relative to another observer.

For example, suppose an astronaut measures the time it takes for light to travel from the light source, cross her ship, bounce off a mirror, and return. (See [Figure 10 02 astronaut](Figure_10_02_astronaut).) How does the elapsed time the astronaut measures compare with the elapsed time measured for the same event by a person on the earth? Asking this question (another thought experiment) produces a profound result. We find that the elapsed time for a process depends on who is measuring it. In this case, the time measured by the astronaut is smaller than the time measured by the earth bound observer. The passage of time is different for the two observers because the distance the light travels in the astronaut’s frame is smaller than in the earth bound frame. Light travels at the same speed in each frame, and so it will take longer to travel the greater distance in the earth bound frame.

and *v* and *c* are the speeds of the moving observer and light, respectively.

Try putting some values for *v* into the expression for the relativistic factor ( <math>        <mi>γ</mi>      </math> ). Observe at which speeds this factor will make a difference and when  ). Observe at which speeds this factor will make a difference and when <math>        <mrow>          <mtext>γ</mtext>        </mrow>      </math> is so close to 1 that it can be ignored.

Try 225 m/s, the speed of an airliner; 2.98 × 10<sup>4</sup> m/s, the speed of Earth in its orbit; and 2.990 × 10<sup>8</sup> m/s, the speed of a particle in an accelerator.

Notice that when the velocity *v* is small compared to the speed of light *c*, then *v/c* becomes small, and <math>      <mrow>        <mi>γ</mi>      </mrow>    </math> becomes close to 1. When this happens, time measurements are the same in both frames of reference.  becomes close to 1. When this happens, time measurements are the same in both frames of reference. **Relativistic** effects, meaning those that have to do with special relativity, usually become significant when speeds become comparable to the speed of light. This is seen to be the case for time dilation.

You may have seen science fiction movies in which space travelers return to Earth after a long trip to find that the planet and everyone on it has aged much more than they have. This type of scenario is a based on a thought experiment, known as the **twin paradox**, which imagines a pair of twins, one of whom goes on a trip into space while the other stays home. When the space traveler returns, she finds her twin has aged much more than she. This happens because the traveling twin has been in two **frames of reference**, one leaving Earth and one returning.

Time dilation has been confirmed by comparing the time recorded by an atomic clock sent into orbit to the time recorded by a clock that remained on Earth. GPS satellites must also be adjusted to compensate for time dilation in order to give accurate positioning.

Have you ever driven on a road, like that shown in [Figure 10 02 road](Figure_10_02_road), that seems like it goes on forever? If you look ahead, you might say you have about 10 km left to go. Another traveler might say the road ahead looks like it is about 15 km long. If you both measured the road, however, you would agree. Traveling at everyday speeds, the distance you both measure would be the same. You will read in this section, however, that this is not true at relativistic speeds. Close to the speed of light, distances measured are not the same when measured by different observers moving with respect to one other.

One thing all observers agree upon is their **relative speed**. When one observer is traveling away from another, they both see the other receding at the same speed, regardless of whose frame of reference is chosen. Remember that speed equals distance divided by time: *v = d/t*. If the observers experience a difference in elapsed time, they must also observe a difference in distance traversed. This is because the ratio *d/t* must be the same for both observers.

The shortening of distance experienced by an observer moving with respect to the points whose distance apart is measured is called **length contraction**. **Proper length**, *L*0, is the distance between two points measured in the reference frame where the observer and the points are at rest. The observer in motion with respect to the points measures *L*. These two lengths are related by the equation

To see how length contraction is seen by a moving observer, go to [temporarily unnamed link](). Here you can also see that simultaneity, time dilation, and length contraction are interrelated phenomena.

This link is to a simulation that illustrates the relativity of simultaneous events.

In classical physics, momentum is a simple product of mass and velocity. When special relativity is taken into account, objects that have mass have a speed limit. What effect do you think mass and velocity have on the momentum of objects moving at relativistic speeds; i.e., speeds close to the speed of light?

**Momentum** is one of the most important concepts in physics. The broadest form of Newton’s second law is stated in terms of momentum. Momentum is conserved in classical mechanics whenever the net external force on a system is zero. This makes momentum conservation a fundamental tool for analyzing collisions. We will see that momentum has the same importance in modern physics. **Relativistic momentum** is conserved, and much of what we know about subatomic structure comes from the analysis of collisions of accelerator-produced relativistic particles.

One of the postulates of special relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. Does the law of conservation of momentum survive this requirement at high velocities? The answer is yes, provided that the momentum is defined as follows.

Relativistic momentum, *p*, is classical momentum multiplied by the relativistic factor <math>        <mrow>          <mi>γ</mi><mtext>.</mtext>        </mrow>      </math>

This is another indication that an object with mass cannot reach the speed of light. If it did, its momentum would become infinite, which is an unreasonable value.

Relativistic momentum is defined in such a way that the conservation of momentum will hold in all inertial frames. Whenever the net external force on a system is zero, relativistic momentum is conserved, just as is the case for classical momentum. This has been verified in numerous experiments.



### Mass-Energy Equivalence

Let us summarize the calculation of relativistic effects on objects moving at speeds near the speed of light. In each case we will need to calculate the relativistic factor, given by

<equation id="fs-id1164354832919" class="unnumbered"><label /> <math display="block">      <mrow>        <mi>γ</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac>          <mn>1</mn>          <mrow>            <msqrt>              <mrow>                <mn>1</mn><mo>−</mo><mfrac>                  <mrow>                    <msup>                      <mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><mi>v</mi></mstyle>                      <mn>2</mn>                    </msup>                  </mrow>                  <mrow>                    <msup>                      <mi>c</mi>                      <mn>2</mn>                    </msup>                  </mrow>                </mfrac>              </mrow>            </msqrt>          </mrow>        </mfrac>        <mo>,</mo>      </mrow>    </math>    </equation>
where *v* and  *c* are as defined earlier. We use *u* as the velocity of a particle or an object in one frame of reference, and *v* for the velocity of one frame of reference with respect to another.

where *L*0 is the length measured on the moving object.

### Relativistic Energy

The original source of all the energy we use is the conversion of mass into energy. Most of this energy is generated by nuclear reactions in the sun and radiated to Earth in the form of electromagnetic radiation, where it is then transformed into all the forms with which we are familiar. The remaining energy from nuclear reactions is produced in nuclear power plants and in Earth’s interior. In each of these cases, the source of the energy is the conversion of a small amount of mass into a large amount of energy. These sources are shown in [Figure 10 02 energy](Figure_10_02_energy).

![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_10_02_energy.jpg)<p>The sun (a) and the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station (b) both convert mass into energy. ((a) NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, Scientific Visualization Studio; (b) U.S. government)</p>
The first postulate of relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. Einstein showed that the law of conservation of energy is valid relativistically, if we define energy to include a relativistic factor. The result of his analysis is that a particle or object of mass *m* moving at velocity *u* has **relativistic energy** given by

<equation id="fs-id1164354626061" class="unnumbered">      <label /> <math display="block">      <mrow>        <mi>E</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>γ</mi><mi>m</mi><msup>          <mi>c</mi>          <mn>2</mn>        </msup>        <mo>.</mo>      </mrow>    </math>    </equation>    
This is the expression for the **total energy** of an object of mass *m* at any speed *u* and includes both **kinetic** and **potential energy**.

Then the rest energy, *E*0, is simply

<equation id="fs-id1164354626824" class="unnumbered"><label /> <math display="block">      <mrow>        <msub>          <mi>E</mi>          <mn>0</mn>        </msub>        <mo>=</mo><mi>m</mi><msup>          <mi>c</mi>          <mn>2</mn>        </msup>        <mo>.</mo>      </mrow>    </math>    </equation>    
This is the correct form of Einstein’s famous equation.

This equation is very useful to nuclear physicists because it can be used to calculate the energy released by a nuclear reaction. This is done simply by subtracting the mass of the products of such a reaction from the mass of the reactants. The difference is the *m* in <math>      <mrow>        <msub>          <mi>E</mi>          <mn>0</mn>        </msub>        <mo>=</mo><mi>m</mi><msup>          <mi>c</mi>          <mn>2</mn>        </msup>        <mtext>.</mtext>      </mrow>    </math>  Here is a simple example:  Here is a simple example:

Because both particles have a rest mass of 9.11 × 10<sup>–31</sup> kg, we multiply the *mc*<sup>2</sup> term by 2. So the energy of the gamma rays is

where we have the expression for the joule (J) in terms of its SI base units of kg, m, and s. In general, the nuclei of stable isotopes have less mass then their constituent subatomic particles. The energy equivalent of this difference is called the **binding energy** of the nucleus. This energy is released during the formation of the isotope from its constituent particles because the product is more stable than the reactants. Expressed as mass, it is called the **mass defect**. For example, a helium nucleus is made of two neutrons and two protons and has a mass of 4.0003 atomic mass units (u). The sum of the masses of two protons and two neutrons is 4.0330 u. The mass defect then is 0.0327 u. Converted to kg, the mass defect is 5.0442 × 10<sup>–30</sup> kg. Multiplying this mass times *c*<sup>2</sup> gives a binding energy of 4.540 × 10<sup>–12</sup> J. This does not sound like much because it is only one atom. If you were to make one gram of helium out of neutrons and protons, it would release 683,000,000,000 J. By comparison, burning one gram of coal releases about 24 J.



## The RHIC Collider
[Figure 10 02 lab](Figure_10_02_lab) shows the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, NY. The circular structure houses a particle accelerator called the RHIC, which stands for Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The heavy ions in the name are gold nuclei that have been stripped of their electrons. Streams of ions are accelerated in several stages before entering the big ring seen in the figure. Here, they are accelerated to their final speed, which is about 99.7 percent the speed of light. Such high speeds are called relativistic. All the relativistic phenomena we have been discussing in this chapter are very pronounced in this case. At this speed <math>        <mrow>          <mi>γ</mi>        </mrow>      </math> = 12.9, so that relativistic time dilates by a factor of about 13, and relativistic length contracts by the same factor. = 12.9, so that relativistic time dilates by a factor of about 13, and relativistic length contracts by the same factor.

Two ion beams circle the 2.4-mile long track around the big ring in opposite directions. The paths can then be made to cross, thereby causing ions to collide. The collision event is very short-lived but amazingly intense. The temperatures and pressures produced are greater than those in the hottest suns. At 4 trillion degrees Celsius, this is the hottest material ever created in a laboratory

But what is the point of creating such an extreme event? Under these conditions, the neutrons and protons that make up the gold nuclei are smashed apart into their components, which are called quarks and gluons. The goal is to recreate the conditions that theorists believe existed at the very beginning of the universe. It is thought that, at that time, matter was a sort of soup of quarks and gluons. When things cooled down after the initial bang, these particles condensed to form protons and neutrons.

Some of the results have been surprising and unexpected. It was thought the quark-gluon soup would resemble a gas or plasma. Instead, it behaves more like a liquid. It has been called a *perfect* liquid because it has virtually no viscosity, meaning that it has no resistance to flow.

Calculate the relativistic factor *γ*, for a particle traveling at 99.7 percent of the speed of light.

## The Speed of Light
One night you are out looking up at the stars and an extraterrestrial spaceship flashes across the sky. The ship is 50 meters long and is travelling at 95 percent of the speed of light. What would the ship’s length be when measured from your earthbound frame of reference?

## Strategy
List the knowns and unknowns.

Knowns: proper length of the ship, *L* = 50 m; velocity, *v*, = 0.95*c*

Unknowns: observed length of the ship accounting for relativistic length contraction, *L*.

Choose the relevant equation.

Be sure to also square the decimal representing the percentage before subtracting from 1. Note that the aliens will still see the length as *L*0 because they are moving with the frame of reference that is the ship.

A comet reaches its greatest speed as it travels near the sun. True or false Relativistic effects make the comets tail look longer to an observer on Earth.

1. True
2. False



### Critical Thinking

Halleys Comet comes near Earth every 75 years as it travels around its 22 billion km orbit at a speed of up to 700, 000 m/s. If it were possible to put a clock on the comet and read it each time the comet passed, which part of special relativity theory could be tested? What would be the expected result? Explain.

1. It would test time dilation. The clock would appear to be slightly slower.
2. It would test time dilation. The clock would appear to be slightly faster.
3. It would test length contraction. The length of the orbit would appear to be shortened from Earths frame of reference.
4. It would test length contraction. The length of the orbit would appear to be shortened from the comets frame of reference.

True or falseIt is possible to just use the relationships *F* = *ma* and *E* = *Fd* to show that both sides of the equation E0 = mc<sup>2</sup> have the same units.

1. True
2. False

The sun loses about 4 × 10<sup>9</sup> kg of mass every second. Explain in terms of special relativity why this is happening.

1. The sun loses mass because of its high temperature.
2. The sun loses mass because it is continuously releasing energy.
3. The Sun loses mass because the diameter of the sun is contracted.
4. The sun loses mass because the speed of the sun is very high and close to the speed of light.

A helium-4 nucleus is made up of two neutrons and two protons. The binding energy of helium-4 is 4.53×10<sup>-12</sup> J. What is the difference in the mass of this helium nucleus and the sum of the masses of two neutrons and two protons? Which weighs more, the nucleus or its constituents?

1. 1.51×10<sup>-20</sup> kg; the constituents weigh more
2. 5.03×10<sup>-29</sup> kg; the constituents weigh more
3. 1.51×10<sup>-29</sup> kg; the nucleus weighs more
4. 5.03×10<sup>-29</sup> kg; the nucleus weighs more

Use the equation for length contraction to explain the relationship between the length of an object perceived by a stationary observer who sees the object as moving, and the proper length of the object as measured in the frame of reference where it is at rest.

1. As the speed *v* of an object moving with respect to a stationary observer approaches *c*, the length perceived by the observer approaches zero. For other speeds, the length perceived is always less than the proper length.
2. As the speed *v* of an object moving with respect to a stationary observer approaches *c*, the length perceived by the observer approaches zero. For other speeds, the length perceived is always greater than the proper length.
3. As the speed *v* of an object moving with respect to a stationary observer approaches *c*, the length perceived by the observer approaches infinity. For other speeds, the length perceived is always less than the proper length.
4. As the speed *v* of an object moving with respect to a stationary observer approaches *c*, the length perceived by the observer approaches infinity. For other speeds, the length perceived is always greater than the proper length.



### Performance Task

People are fascinated by the possibility of traveling across the universe to discover intelligent life on other planets. To do this, we would have to travel enormous distances. Suppose we could somehow travel at up to 90 percent of the speed of light. The closest star is Alpha Centauri, which is 4.37 light years away. (A light year is the distance light travels in one year.)

1. How long, from the point of view of people on Earth, would it take a space ship to travel to Alpha Centauri and back at 0.9*c*?
2. How much would the astronauts on the spaceship have aged by the time they got back to Earth?
3. Discuss the problems related to travel to stars that are 20 or 30 light years away. Assume travel speeds near the speed of light.
