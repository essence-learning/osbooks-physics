## Introduction

Recall from the chapter on Motion in Two Dimensions that oscillations—the back-and-forth movement between two points—involve force and energy. Some oscillations create waves, such as the sound waves created by plucking a guitar string. Other examples of waves include earthquakes and visible light. Even subatomic particles, such as electrons, can behave like waves. You can make water waves in a swimming pool by slapping the water with your hand. Some of these waves, such as water waves, are visible; others, such as sound waves, are not. But every wave is a disturbance that moves from its source and carries energy. In this chapter, we will learn about the different types of waves, their properties, and how they interact with one another.
