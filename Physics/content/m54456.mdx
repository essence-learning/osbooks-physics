### Changing Magnetic Fields

In the preceding section, we learned that a current creates a magnetic field. If nature is symmetrical, then perhaps a magnetic field can create a current. In 1831, some 12 years after the discovery that an electric current generates a magnetic field, English scientist Michael Faraday (1791–1862) and American scientist Joseph Henry (1797–1878) independently demonstrated that magnetic fields can produce currents. The basic process of generating currents with magnetic fields is called **induction**; this process is also called **magnetic induction** to distinguish it from charging by induction, which uses the electrostatic Coulomb force.

When Faraday discovered what is now called Faraday’s law of induction, Queen Victoria asked him what possible use was electricity. “Madam,” he replied, “What good is a baby?” Today, currents induced by magnetic fields are essential to our technological society. The electric generator—found in everything from automobiles to bicycles to nuclear power plants—uses magnetism to generate electric current. Other devices that use magnetism to induce currents include pickup coils in electric guitars, transformers of every size, certain microphones, airport security gates, and damping mechanisms on sensitive chemical balances.

One experiment Faraday did to demonstrate magnetic induction was to move a bar magnet through a wire coil and measure the resulting electric current through the wire. A schematic of this experiment is shown in [None](None). He found that current is induced only when the magnet moves with respect to the coil. When the magnet is motionless with respect to the coil, no current is induced in the coil, as in [None](None). In addition, moving the magnet in the opposite direction (compare [None](None) with [None](None)) or reversing the poles of the magnet (compare [None](None) with [None](None)) results in a current in the opposite direction.


<caption>Movement of a magnet relative to a coil produces electric currents as shown. The same currents are produced if the coil is moved relative to the magnet. The greater the speed, the greater the magnitude of the current, and the current is zero when there is no motion. The current produced by moving the magnet upward is in the opposite direction as the current produced by moving the magnet downward.</caption>
## Faraday’s Law

Try this simulation to see how moving a magnet creates a current in a circuit. A light bulb lights up to show when current is flowing, and a voltmeter shows the voltage drop across the light bulb. Try moving the magnet through a four-turn coil and through a two-turn coil. For the same magnet speed, which coil produces a higher voltage?

### Induced Electromotive Force

If a current is induced in the coil, Faraday reasoned that there must be what he called an *electromotive force* pushing the charges through the coil. This interpretation turned out to be incorrect; instead, the external source doing the work of moving the magnet adds energy to the charges in the coil. The energy added per unit charge has units of volts, so the electromotive force is actually a potential. Unfortunately, the name electromotive force stuck and with it the potential for confusing it with a real force. For this reason, we avoid the term *electromotive force* and just use the abbreviation *emf*, which has the mathematical symbol  ε.  The **emf** may be defined as the rate at which energy is drawn from a source per unit current flowing through a circuit. Thus, emf is the energy per unit charge *added* by a source, which contrasts with voltage, which is the energy per unit charge* released* as the charges flow through a circuit.

To understand why an emf is generated in a coil due to a moving magnet, consider [None](None), which shows a bar magnet moving downward with respect to a wire loop. Initially, seven magnetic field lines are going through the loop (see left-hand image). Because the magnet is moving away from the coil, only five magnetic field lines are going through the loop after a short time  Δt  (see right-hand image). Thus, when a change occurs in the number of magnetic field lines going through the area defined by the wire loop, an emf is induced in the wire loop. Experiments such as this show that the induced emf is proportional to the *rate of change* of the magnetic field. Mathematically, we express this as

ε∝ΔBΔt,where  ΔB  is the change in the magnitude in the magnetic field during time  Δt  and *A* is the area of the loop.


<caption>The bar magnet moves downward with respect to the wire loop, so that the number of magnetic field lines going through the loop decreases with time. This causes an emf to be induced in the loop, creating an electric current.</caption>
Note that magnetic field lines that lie in the plane of the wire loop do not actually pass through the loop, as shown by the left-most loop in [None](None). In this figure, the arrow coming out of the loop is a vector whose magnitude is the area of the loop and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of the loop. In [None](None), as the loop is rotated from  θ=90°
 to  θ=0°,  the contribution of the magnetic field lines to the emf increases. Thus, what is important in generating an emf in the wire loop is the component of the magnetic field that is *perpendicular* to the plane of the loop, which is  Bcosθ. 

This is analogous to a sail in the wind. Think of the conducting loop as the sail and the magnetic field as the wind. To maximize the force of the wind on the sail, the sail is oriented so that its surface vector points in the same direction as the winds, as in the right-most loop in [None](None). When the sail is aligned so that its surface vector is perpendicular to the wind, as in the left-most loop in [None](None), then the wind exerts no force on the sail.

Thus, taking into account the angle of the magnetic field with respect to the area, the proportionality  E∝ΔB/Δt  becomes

E∝ΔBcosθΔt.
<caption>The magnetic field lies in the plane of the left-most loop, so it cannot generate an emf in this case. When the loop is rotated so that the angle of the magnetic field with the vector perpendicular to the area of the loop increases to  </caption>
Another way to reduce the number of magnetic field lines that go through the conducting loop in [None](None) is not to move the magnet but to make the loop smaller. Experiments show that changing the area of a conducting loop in a stable magnetic field induces an emf in the loop. Thus, the emf produced in a conducting loop is proportional to the rate of change of the *product* of the perpendicular magnetic field and the loop area

ε∝Δ[(Bcosθ)A]Δt,where  Bcosθ  is the perpendicular magnetic field and *A* is the area of the loop. The product  BAcosθ  is very important. It is proportional to the number of magnetic field lines that pass perpendicularly through a surface of area *A*. Going back to our sail analogy, it would be proportional to the force of the wind on the sail. It is called the **magnetic flux** and is represented by  Φ .

Φ=BAcosθThe unit of magnetic flux is the weber (Wb), which is magnetic field per unit area, or T/m<sup>2</sup>. The weber is also a volt second (Vs).

The induced emf is in fact proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through a conducting loop.

ε∝ΔΦΔtFinally, for a coil made from *N* loops, the emf is *N* times stronger than for a single loop. Thus, the emf induced by a changing magnetic field in a coil of *N* loops is

ε∝NΔBcosθΔtA.The last question to answer before we can change the proportionality into an equation is “In what direction does the current flow?” The Russian scientist Heinrich Lenz (1804–1865) explained that the current flows in the direction that creates a magnetic field that tries to keep the flux constant in the loop. For example, consider again [None](None). The motion of the bar magnet causes the number of upward-pointing magnetic field lines that go through the loop to decrease. Therefore, an emf is generated in the loop that drives a current in the direction that creates more upward-pointing magnetic field lines. By using the right-hand rule, we see that this current must flow in the direction shown in the figure. To express the fact that the induced emf acts to counter the change in the magnetic flux through a wire loop, a minus sign is introduced into the proportionality  ε∝ΔΦ/Δt., which gives Faraday’s law of induction.

ε=−NΔΦΔtLenz’s law is very important. To better understand it, consider [None](None), which shows a magnet moving with respect to a wire coil and the direction of the resulting current in the coil. In the top row, the north pole of the magnet approaches the coil, so the magnetic field lines from the magnet point toward the coil. Thus, the magnetic field  B→mag=Bmag(x^)  pointing to the right increases in the coil. According to Lenz’s law, the emf produced in the coil will drive a current in the direction that creates a magnetic field  B→coil=Bcoil(−x^)  inside the coil pointing to the left. This will counter the increase in magnetic flux pointing to the right. To see which way the current must flow, point your right thumb in the desired direction of the magnetic field  B→coil,  and the current will flow in the direction indicated by curling your right fingers. This is shown by the image of the right hand in the top row of [None](None). Thus, the current must flow in the direction shown in [Figure 4(a)](None).

In [Figure 4(b)](None), the direction in which the magnet moves is reversed. In the coil, the right-pointing magnetic field  B→mag  due to the moving magnet decreases. Lenz’s law says that, to counter this decrease, the emf will drive a current that creates an additional right-pointing magnetic field  B→coil  in the coil. Again, point your right thumb in the desired direction of the magnetic field, and the current will flow in the direction indicate by curling your right fingers ([Figure 4(b)](None)).

Finally, in [Figure 4(c)](None), the magnet is reversed so that the south pole is nearest the coil. Now the magnetic field  B→mag  points toward the magnet instead of toward the coil. As the magnet approaches the coil, it causes the left-pointing magnetic field in the coil to increase. Lenz’s law tells us that the emf induced in the coil will drive a current in the direction that creates a magnetic field pointing to the right. This will counter the increasing magnetic flux pointing to the left due to the magnet. Using the right-hand rule again, as indicated in the figure, shows that the current must flow in the direction shown in [Figure 4(c)](None).


<caption>Lenz’s law tells us that the magnetically induced emf will drive a current that resists the change in the magnetic flux through a circuit. This is shown in panels (a)–(c) for various magnet orientations and velocities. The right hands at right show how to apply the right-hand rule to find in which direction the induced current flows around the coil.</caption>
## Faraday’s Electromagnetic Lab

This simulation proposes several activities. For now, click on the tab Pickup Coil, which presents a bar magnet that you can move through a coil. As you do so, you can see the electrons move in the coil and a light bulb will light up or a voltmeter will indicate the voltage across a resistor. Note that the voltmeter allows you to see the sign of the voltage as you move the magnet about. You can also leave the bar magnet at rest and move the coil, although it is more difficult to observe the results.

## Induced Current in a Wire
This video explains how a current can be induced in a straight wire by moving it through a magnetic field. The lecturer uses the *cross product*, which a type of vector multiplication. Don’t worry if you are not familiar with this, it basically combines the right-hand rule for determining the force on the charges in the wire with the equation  F=qvBsinθ.



What emf is produced across a straight wire 0.50 m long moving at a velocity of (1.5 m/s) x^  through a uniform magnetic field (0.30 T)*ẑ*? The wire lies in the *ŷ*-direction. Also, which end of the wire is at the higher potential—let the lower end of the wire be at *y* = 0 and the upper end at *y* = 0.5 m)?

1. 0.15 V and the lower end of the wire will be at higher potential
2. 0.15 V and the upper end of the wire will be at higher potential
3. 0.075 V and the lower end of the wire will be at higher potential
4. 0.075 V and the upper end of the wire will be at higher potential

## EMF Induced in Conducing Coil by Moving Magnet
Imagine a magnetic field goes through a coil in the direction indicated in [None](None). The coil diameter is 2.0 cm. If the magnetic field goes from 0.020 to 0.010 T in 34 s, what is the direction and magnitude of the induced current? Assume the coil has a resistance of 0.1  Ω. 


<caption>A coil through which passes a magnetic field </caption>
## Strategy
Use the equation  ε=−NΔΦ/Δt  to find the induced emf in the coil, where  Δt=34s . Counting the number of loops in the solenoid, we find it has 16 loops, so  N=16.  Use the equation  Φ=BAcosθ  to calculate the magnetic flux

Φ=BAcosθ=Bπ(d2)2,where *d* is the diameter of the solenoid and we have used  cos0°=1.  Because the area of the solenoid does not vary, the change in the magnetic of the flux through the solenoid is

ΔΦ=ΔBπ(d2)2.Once we find the emf, we can use Ohm’s law,  ε=IR,  to find the current.

Finally, Lenz’s law tells us that the current should produce a magnetic field that acts to oppose the decrease in the applied magnetic field. Thus, the current should produce a magnetic field to the right.

## Solution
Combining equations  ε=−NΔΦ/Δt
 and  Φ=BAcosθ
 gives

ε=−NΔΦΔt=−NΔBπd24Δt.Solving Ohm’s law for the current and using this result gives

I=εR=−NΔBπd24RΔt
     =−16(−0.010T)π(0.020m)24(0.10Ω)(34s)
     =15μA.Lenz’s law tells us that the current must produce a magnetic field to the right. Thus, we point our right thumb to the right and curl our right fingers around the solenoid. The current must flow in the direction in which our fingers are pointing, so it enters at the left end of the solenoid and exits at the right end.

## Discussion
Let’s see if the minus sign makes sense in Faraday’s law of induction. Define the direction of the magnetic field to be the positive direction. This means the change in the magnetic field is negative, as we found above. The minus sign in Faraday’s law of induction negates the negative change in the magnetic field, leaving us with a positive current. Therefore, the current must flow in the direction of the magnetic field, which is what we found.

Now try defining the positive direction to be the direction opposite that of the magnetic field, that is positive is to the left in [None](None). In this case, you will find a negative current. But since the positive direction is to the left, a negative current must flow to the right, which again agrees with what we found by using Lenz’s law.

## Magnetic Induction due to Changing Circuit Size
The circuit shown in [None](None) consists of a U-shaped wire with a resistor and with the ends connected by a sliding conducting rod. The magnetic field filling the area enclosed by the circuit is constant at 0.01 T. If the rod is pulled to the right at speed  v=0.50m/s,  what current is induced in the circuit and in what direction does the current flow?

<caption>A slider circuit. The magnetic field is constant and the rod is pulled to the right at speed </caption>
## Strategy
We again use Faraday’s law of induction,  E=−NΔΦΔt,  although this time the magnetic field is constant and the area enclosed by the circuit changes. The circuit contains a single loop, so  N=1.  The rate of change of the area is  ΔAΔt=vℓ.  Thus the rate of change of the magnetic flux is

ΔΦΔt=Δ(BAcosθ)Δt=BΔAΔt=Bvℓ,where we have used the fact that the angle  θ  between the area vector and the magnetic field is 0°. Once we know the emf, we can find the current by using Ohm’s law. To find the direction of the current, we apply Lenz’s law.

## Solution
Faraday’s law of induction gives

E=−NΔΦΔt=−Bvℓ.Solving Ohm’s law for the current and using the previous result for emf gives

I=ER=−BvℓR=−(0.010T)(0.50m/s)(0.10m)20Ω=25μA.As the rod slides to the right, the magnetic flux passing through the circuit increases. Lenz’s law tells us that the current induced will create a magnetic field that will counter this increase. Thus, the magnetic field created by the induced current must be into the page. Curling your right-hand fingers around the loop in the clockwise direction makes your right thumb point into the page, which is the desired direction of the magnetic field. Thus, the current must flow in the clockwise direction around the circuit.

## Discussion
Is energy conserved in this circuit? An external agent must pull on the rod with sufficient force to just balance the force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field—recall that  F=IℓBsinθ.  The rate at which this force does work on the rod should be balanced by the rate at which the circuit dissipates power. Using  F=IℓBsinθ,  the force required to pull the wire at a constant speed *v* is

Fpull=IℓBsinθ=IℓB,where we used the fact that the angle  θ  between the current and the magnetic field is 90°.  Inserting our expression above for the current into this equation gives

Fpull=IℓB=−BvℓR(ℓB)=−B2vℓ2R.The power contributed by the agent pulling the rod is Fpullv, or 

Ppull=Fpullv=−B2v2ℓ2R.The power dissipated by the circuit is

Pdissipated=I2R=(−BvℓR)2R=B2v2ℓ2R.We thus see that  Ppull+Pdissipated=0,  which means that power is conserved in the system consisting of the circuit and the agent that pulls the rod. Thus, energy is conserved in this system.

Explain how magnetic flux can be zero when the magnetic field is not zero.

1. If angle between magnetic field and area vector is 0°, then its sine is also zero, which means that there is zero flux.
2. If angle between magnetic field and area vector is 45°, then its sine is also zero, which means that there is zero flux.
3. If angle between magnetic field and area vector is 60°, then its cosine is also zero, which means that there is zero flux.
4. If the angle between magnetic field and area vector is 90°, then its cosine is also zero, which means that there is zero flux.



### Critical Thinking

To obtain power from the current in the wire of your vacuum cleaner, you place a loop of wire near it to obtain an induced emf. How do you place and orient the loop?

1. A loop of wire should be placed nearest to the vacuum cleaner wire to maximize the magnetic flux through the loop.
2. A loop of wire should be placed farthest to the vacuum cleaner wire to maximize the magnetic flux through the loop.
3. A loop of wire should be placed perpendicular to the vacuum cleaner wire to maximize the magnetic flux through the loop.
4. A loop of wire should be placed at angle greater than 90° to the vacuum cleaner wire to maximize the magnetic flux through the loop.

A magneto is a device that creates a spark across a gap by creating a large voltage across the gap. To do this, the device spins a magnet very quickly in front of a wire coil, with the ends of the wires forming the gap. Explain how this creates a sufficiently large voltage to produce a spark.

1. The electric field in the coil increases rapidly due to spinning of magnet which creates an emf in the coil that is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux.
2. The magnetic field in the coil changes rapidly due to spinning of magnet which creates an emf in the coil that is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux.
