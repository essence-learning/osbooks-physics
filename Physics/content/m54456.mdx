### Changing Magnetic Fields

In the preceding section, we learned that a current creates a magnetic field. If nature is symmetrical, then perhaps a magnetic field can create a current. In 1831, some 12 years after the discovery that an electric current generates a magnetic field, English scientist Michael Faraday (1791–1862) and American scientist Joseph Henry (1797–1878) independently demonstrated that magnetic fields can produce currents. The basic process of generating currents with magnetic fields is called **induction**; this process is also called **magnetic induction** to distinguish it from charging by induction, which uses the electrostatic Coulomb force.

When Faraday discovered what is now called Faraday’s law of induction, Queen Victoria asked him what possible use was electricity. “Madam,” he replied, “What good is a baby?” Today, currents induced by magnetic fields are essential to our technological society. The electric generator—found in everything from automobiles to bicycles to nuclear power plants—uses magnetism to generate electric current. Other devices that use magnetism to induce currents include pickup coils in electric guitars, transformers of every size, certain microphones, airport security gates, and damping mechanisms on sensitive chemical balances.

One experiment Faraday did to demonstrate magnetic induction was to move a bar magnet through a wire coil and measure the resulting electric current through the wire. A schematic of this experiment is shown in [Figure 20 02 Ammeter](Figure_20_02_Ammeter). He found that current is induced only when the magnet moves with respect to the coil. When the magnet is motionless with respect to the coil, no current is induced in the coil, as in [Figure 20 02 Ammeter](Figure_20_02_Ammeter). In addition, moving the magnet in the opposite direction (compare [Figure 20 02 Ammeter](Figure_20_02_Ammeter) with [Figure 20 02 Ammeter](Figure_20_02_Ammeter)) or reversing the poles of the magnet (compare [Figure 20 02 Ammeter](Figure_20_02_Ammeter) with [Figure 20 02 Ammeter](Figure_20_02_Ammeter)) results in a current in the opposite direction.

![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_20_02_ammeter.jpg)<caption>Movement of a magnet relative to a coil produces electric currents as shown. The same currents are produced if the coil is moved relative to the magnet. The greater the speed, the greater the magnitude of the current, and the current is zero when there is no motion. The current produced by moving the magnet upward is in the opposite direction as the current produced by moving the magnet downward.</caption>
## Faraday’s Law

Try this simulation to see how moving a magnet creates a current in a circuit. A light bulb lights up to show when current is flowing, and a voltmeter shows the voltage drop across the light bulb. Try moving the magnet through a four-turn coil and through a two-turn coil. For the same magnet speed, which coil produces a higher voltage?

### Induced Electromotive Force

If a current is induced in the coil, Faraday reasoned that there must be what he called an *electromotive force* pushing the charges through the coil. This interpretation turned out to be incorrect; instead, the external source doing the work of moving the magnet adds energy to the charges in the coil. The energy added per unit charge has units of volts, so the electromotive force is actually a potential. Unfortunately, the name electromotive force stuck and with it the potential for confusing it with a real force. For this reason, we avoid the term *electromotive force* and just use the abbreviation *emf*, which has the mathematical symbol  <math><mrow> <mi>ε</mi> <mtext>.</mtext> </mrow></math>  The   The **emf** may be defined as the rate at which energy is drawn from a source per unit current flowing through a circuit. Thus, emf is the energy per unit charge *added* by a source, which contrasts with voltage, which is the energy per unit charge* released* as the charges flow through a circuit.

To understand why an emf is generated in a coil due to a moving magnet, consider [Figure 20 02 Two mags](Figure_20_02_Two_mags), which shows a bar magnet moving downward with respect to a wire loop. Initially, seven magnetic field lines are going through the loop (see left-hand image). Because the magnet is moving away from the coil, only five magnetic field lines are going through the loop after a short time  <math> <mrow>  <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>t</mi></mrow></math>  (see right-hand image). Thus, when a change occurs in the number of magnetic field lines going through the area defined by the wire loop, an emf is induced in the wire loop. Experiments such as this show that the induced emf is proportional to the   (see right-hand image). Thus, when a change occurs in the number of magnetic field lines going through the area defined by the wire loop, an emf is induced in the wire loop. Experiments such as this show that the induced emf is proportional to the *rate of change* of the magnetic field. Mathematically, we express this as

<equation id="fs-id1164566544844"> <math display="block"> <mrow>  <mi>ε</mi><mo>∝</mo><mfrac>   <mrow>    <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>B</mi></mrow>   <mrow>    <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>t</mi></mrow>  </mfrac>  <mtext>,</mtext>  </mrow></math> </equation>
where  <math> <mrow>  <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>B</mi></mrow></math>  is the change in the magnitude in the magnetic field during time    is the change in the magnitude in the magnetic field during time  <math> <mrow>  <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>t</mi></mrow></math>  and   and *A* is the area of the loop.

![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_20_02_twomags.jpg)<caption>The bar magnet moves downward with respect to the wire loop, so that the number of magnetic field lines going through the loop decreases with time. This causes an emf to be induced in the loop, creating an electric current.</caption>
Note that magnetic field lines that lie in the plane of the wire loop do not actually pass through the loop, as shown by the left-most loop in [Figure 20 02 Loops](Figure_20_02_Loops). In this figure, the arrow coming out of the loop is a vector whose magnitude is the area of the loop and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of the loop. In [Figure 20 02 Loops](Figure_20_02_Loops), as the loop is rotated from  <math> <mrow>  <mi>θ</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>90°</mn><mo /></mrow></math> to  
 to  <math> <mrow>  <mi>θ</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0°</mn><mo /></mrow><mtext>,</mtext></math>  the contribution of the magnetic field lines to the emf increases. Thus, what is important in generating an emf in the wire loop is the component of the magnetic field that is   the contribution of the magnetic field lines to the emf increases. Thus, what is important in generating an emf in the wire loop is the component of the magnetic field that is *perpendicular* to the plane of the loop, which is  <math> <mrow>  <mi>B</mi><mi>cos</mi><mi>θ</mi></mrow><mtext>.</mtext></math>  

This is analogous to a sail in the wind. Think of the conducting loop as the sail and the magnetic field as the wind. To maximize the force of the wind on the sail, the sail is oriented so that its surface vector points in the same direction as the winds, as in the right-most loop in [Figure 20 02 Loops](Figure_20_02_Loops). When the sail is aligned so that its surface vector is perpendicular to the wind, as in the left-most loop in [Figure 20 02 Loops](Figure_20_02_Loops), then the wind exerts no force on the sail.

Thus, taking into account the angle of the magnetic field with respect to the area, the proportionality  <math> <mrow>  <mi>E</mi><mo>∝</mo><mrow><mrow>   <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>B</mi></mrow><mo>/</mo><mrow>   <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>t</mi></mrow></mrow>  </mrow></math>  becomes  becomes

![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_20_02_loops.jpg)<caption>The magnetic field lies in the plane of the left-most loop, so it cannot generate an emf in this case. When the loop is rotated so that the angle of the magnetic field with the vector perpendicular to the area of the loop increases to  </caption>
Another way to reduce the number of magnetic field lines that go through the conducting loop in [Figure 20 02 Loops](Figure_20_02_Loops) is not to move the magnet but to make the loop smaller. Experiments show that changing the area of a conducting loop in a stable magnetic field induces an emf in the loop. Thus, the emf produced in a conducting loop is proportional to the rate of change of the *product* of the perpendicular magnetic field and the loop area

<equation id="fs-id1164562175985"> <math display="block"> <mrow>  <mi>ε</mi><mo>∝</mo><mfrac>   <mrow>    <mtext>Δ</mtext><mrow><mo>[</mo> <mrow>     <mrow><mo>(</mo>      <mrow>       <mi>B</mi><mi>cos</mi><mi>θ</mi></mrow>     <mo>)</mo></mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow> <mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow>   <mrow>    <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>t</mi></mrow>  </mfrac>  <mtext>,</mtext>  </mrow></math> </equation>
where  <math> <mrow>  <mi>B</mi><mi>cos</mi><mi>θ</mi></mrow></math>  is the perpendicular magnetic field and   is the perpendicular magnetic field and *A* is the area of the loop. The product  <math> <mrow>  <mi>B</mi><mi>A</mi><mi>cos</mi><mi>θ</mi></mrow></math>  is very important. It is proportional to the number of magnetic field lines that pass perpendicularly through a surface of area   is very important. It is proportional to the number of magnetic field lines that pass perpendicularly through a surface of area *A*. Going back to our sail analogy, it would be proportional to the force of the wind on the sail. It is called the **magnetic flux** and is represented by  <math> <mtext>Φ</mtext></math> . .

<equation id="fs-id1164564953508"> <math display="block"> <mrow>  <mtext>Φ</mtext><mo>=</mo><mi>B</mi><mi>A</mi><mi>cos</mi><mi>θ</mi></mrow></math> </equation>
The unit of magnetic flux is the weber (Wb), which is magnetic field per unit area, or T/m<sup>2</sup>. The weber is also a volt second (Vs).

The induced emf is in fact proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through a conducting loop.

<equation id="fs-id1164563573962"> <math display="block"> <mrow>  <mi>ε</mi><mo>∝</mo><mfrac>   <mrow>    <mi>Δ</mi><mtext>Φ</mtext></mrow>   <mrow>    <mi>Δ</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow>  </mfrac>  </mrow></math> </equation>
Finally, for a coil made from *N* loops, the emf is *N* times stronger than for a single loop. Thus, the emf induced by a changing magnetic field in a coil of *N* loops is

<equation id="fs-id1167064743526" class="unnumbered"><label /> <math> <mrow>  <mi>ε</mi><mo>∝</mo><mi>N</mi><mfrac>   <mrow>    <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>B</mi><mi>cos</mi><mi>θ</mi></mrow>   <mrow>    <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>t</mi></mrow>  </mfrac>  <mi>A.</mi></mrow></math> </equation>
The last question to answer before we can change the proportionality into an equation is “In what direction does the current flow?” The Russian scientist Heinrich Lenz (1804–1865) explained that the current flows in the direction that creates a magnetic field that tries to keep the flux constant in the loop. For example, consider again [Figure 20 02 Two mags](Figure_20_02_Two_mags). The motion of the bar magnet causes the number of upward-pointing magnetic field lines that go through the loop to decrease. Therefore, an emf is generated in the loop that drives a current in the direction that creates more upward-pointing magnetic field lines. By using the right-hand rule, we see that this current must flow in the direction shown in the figure. To express the fact that the induced emf acts to counter the change in the magnetic flux through a wire loop, a minus sign is introduced into the proportionality  <math> <mrow>  <mi>ε</mi><mo>∝</mo><mrow><mrow>   <mtext>Δ</mtext><mtext>Φ</mtext></mrow><mo>/</mo><mrow>   <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>t</mi></mrow></mrow><mtext>.</mtext>  </mrow></math>, which gives Faraday’s law of induction., which gives Faraday’s law of induction.

Lenz’s law is very important. To better understand it, consider [Figure 20 02 LL](Figure_20_02_LL), which shows a magnet moving with respect to a wire coil and the direction of the resulting current in the coil. In the top row, the north pole of the magnet approaches the coil, so the magnetic field lines from the magnet point toward the coil. Thus, the magnetic field  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mover accent="true">    <mi>B</mi>    <mo>→</mo>   </mover>   <mrow>    <mtext>mag</mtext></mrow>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo><msub>   <mi>B</mi>   <mrow>    <mtext>mag</mtext></mrow>  </msub>  <mrow><mo>(</mo>   <mover accent="true">    <mi>x</mi>    <mo>^</mo>   </mover>  <mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>  pointing to the right increases in the coil. According to Lenz’s law, the emf produced in the coil will drive a current in the direction that creates a magnetic field    pointing to the right increases in the coil. According to Lenz’s law, the emf produced in the coil will drive a current in the direction that creates a magnetic field  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mover accent="true">    <mi>B</mi>    <mo>→</mo>   </mover>   <mrow>    <mtext>coil</mtext></mrow>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo><msub>   <mi>B</mi>   <mrow>    <mtext>coil</mtext></mrow>  </msub>  <mrow><mo>(</mo>   <mrow>    <mo>−</mo><mover accent="true">     <mi>x</mi>     <mo>^</mo>    </mover>    </mrow>  <mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>  inside the coil pointing to the left. This will counter the increase in magnetic flux pointing to the right. To see which way the current must flow, point your right thumb in the desired direction of the magnetic field    inside the coil pointing to the left. This will counter the increase in magnetic flux pointing to the right. To see which way the current must flow, point your right thumb in the desired direction of the magnetic field  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mover accent="true">    <mi>B</mi>    <mo>→</mo>   </mover>   <mrow>    <mtext>coil,</mtext></mrow>  </msub>  </mrow></math>  and the current will flow in the direction indicated by curling your right fingers. This is shown by the image of the right hand in the top row of   and the current will flow in the direction indicated by curling your right fingers. This is shown by the image of the right hand in the top row of [Figure 20 02 LL](Figure_20_02_LL). Thus, the current must flow in the direction shown in [Figure 20 02 LL](Figure_20_02_LL).

In [Figure 20 02 LL](Figure_20_02_LL), the direction in which the magnet moves is reversed. In the coil, the right-pointing magnetic field  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mover accent="true">    <mi>B</mi>    <mo>→</mo>   </mover>   <mrow>    <mtext>mag</mtext></mrow>  </msub>  </mrow></math>  due to the moving magnet decreases. Lenz’s law says that, to counter this decrease, the emf will drive a current that creates an additional right-pointing magnetic field    due to the moving magnet decreases. Lenz’s law says that, to counter this decrease, the emf will drive a current that creates an additional right-pointing magnetic field  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mover accent="true">    <mi>B</mi>    <mo>→</mo>   </mover>   <mrow>    <mtext>coil</mtext></mrow>  </msub>  </mrow></math>  in the coil. Again, point your right thumb in the desired direction of the magnetic field, and the current will flow in the direction indicate by curling your right fingers (  in the coil. Again, point your right thumb in the desired direction of the magnetic field, and the current will flow in the direction indicate by curling your right fingers ([Figure 20 02 LL](Figure_20_02_LL)).

Finally, in [Figure 20 02 LL](Figure_20_02_LL), the magnet is reversed so that the south pole is nearest the coil. Now the magnetic field  <math> <mrow>  <msub>   <mover accent="true">    <mi>B</mi>    <mo>→</mo>   </mover>   <mrow>    <mtext>mag</mtext></mrow>  </msub>  </mrow></math>  points toward the magnet instead of toward the coil. As the magnet approaches the coil, it causes the left-pointing magnetic field in the coil to increase. Lenz’s law tells us that the emf induced in the coil will drive a current in the direction that creates a magnetic field pointing to the right. This will counter the increasing magnetic flux pointing to the left due to the magnet. Using the right-hand rule again, as indicated in the figure, shows that the current must flow in the direction shown in   points toward the magnet instead of toward the coil. As the magnet approaches the coil, it causes the left-pointing magnetic field in the coil to increase.

## Faraday’s Electromagnetic Lab

This simulation proposes several activities. For now, click on the tab Pickup Coil, which presents a bar magnet that you can move through a coil. As you do so, you can see the electrons move in the coil and a light bulb will light up or a voltmeter will indicate the voltage across a resistor. Note that the voltmeter allows you to see the sign of the voltage as you move the magnet about. You can also leave the bar magnet at rest and move the coil, although it is more difficult to observe the results.

1. 0.15 V and the lower end of the wire will be at higher potential
2. 0.15 V and the upper end of the wire will be at higher potential

## EMF Induced in Conducing Coil by Moving Magnet
Imagine a magnetic field goes through a coil in the direction indicated in [Figure 20 02 Coil](Figure_20_02_Coil). The coil diameter is 2.0 cm. If the magnetic field goes from 0.020 to 0.010 T in 34 s, what is the direction and magnitude of the induced current? Assume the coil has a resistance of 0.1  <math> <mtext>Ω.</mtext></math>

Lenz’s law tells us that the current must produce a magnetic field to the right. Thus, we point our right thumb to the right and curl our right fingers around the solenoid. The current must flow in the direction in which our fingers are pointing, so it enters at the left end of the solenoid and exits at the right end.

## Discussion
Let’s see if the minus sign makes sense in Faraday’s law of induction. Define the direction of the magnetic field to be the positive direction. This means the change in the magnetic field is negative, as we found above. The minus sign in Faraday’s law of induction negates the negative change in the magnetic field, leaving us with a positive current. Therefore, the current must flow in the direction of the magnetic field, which is what we found.

Now try defining the positive direction to be the direction opposite that of the magnetic field, that is positive is to the left in [Figure 20 02 Coil](Figure_20_02_Coil). In this case, you will find a negative current. But since the positive direction is to the left, a negative current must flow to the right, which again agrees with what we found by using Lenz’s law.

As the rod slides to the right, the magnetic flux passing through the circuit increases. Lenz’s law tells us that the current induced will create a magnetic field that will counter this increase. Thus, the magnetic field created by the induced current must be into the page. Curling your right-hand fingers around the loop in the clockwise direction makes your right thumb point into the page, which is the desired direction of the magnetic field. Thus, the current must flow in the clockwise direction around the circuit.

Explain how magnetic flux can be zero when the magnetic field is not zero.

1. If angle between magnetic field and area vector is 0°, then its sine is also zero, which means that there is zero flux.
2. If angle between magnetic field and area vector is 45°, then its sine is also zero, which means that there is zero flux.
3. If angle between magnetic field and area vector is 60°, then its cosine is also zero, which means that there is zero flux.
4. If the angle between magnetic field and area vector is 90°, then its cosine is also zero, which means that there is zero flux.



### Critical Thinking

To obtain power from the current in the wire of your vacuum cleaner, you place a loop of wire near it to obtain an induced emf. How do you place and orient the loop?

1. A loop of wire should be placed nearest to the vacuum cleaner wire to maximize the magnetic flux through the loop.
2. A loop of wire should be placed farthest to the vacuum cleaner wire to maximize the magnetic flux through the loop.
3. A loop of wire should be placed perpendicular to the vacuum cleaner wire to maximize the magnetic flux through the loop.
4. A loop of wire should be placed at angle greater than 90° to the vacuum cleaner wire to maximize the magnetic flux through the loop.

A magneto is a device that creates a spark across a gap by creating a large voltage across the gap. To do this, the device spins a magnet very quickly in front of a wire coil, with the ends of the wires forming the gap. Explain how this creates a sufficiently large voltage to produce a spark.

1. The electric field in the coil increases rapidly due to spinning of magnet which creates an emf in the coil that is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux.
2. The magnetic field in the coil changes rapidly due to spinning of magnet which creates an emf in the coil that is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux.
