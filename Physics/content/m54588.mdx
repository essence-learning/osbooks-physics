### Understanding the Grand Unified Theory

Present quests to show that the four basic forces are different manifestations of a single unified force that follow a long tradition. In the nineteenth century, the distinct electric and magnetic forces were shown to be intimately connected and are now collectively called the electromagnetic force. More recently, the weak nuclear force was united with the electromagnetic force. As shown in [None](None), carrier particles transmit three of the four fundamental forces in very similar ways. With these considerations in mind, it is natural to suggest that a theory may be constructed in which the strong nuclear, weak nuclear, and electromagnetic forces are all unified. The search for a correct theory linking the forces, called the **Grand Unified Theory (GUT)**, is explored in this section.

In the 1960s, the **electroweak theory** was developed by Steven Weinberg, Sheldon Glashow, and Abdus Salam. This theory proposed that the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces are identical at sufficiently high energies. At lower energies, like those in our present-day universe, the two forces remain united but manifest themselves in different ways. One of the main consequences of the electroweak theory was the prediction of three short-range carrier particles, now known as the  <math>

How can forces be unified? They are definitely distinct under most circumstances. For example, they are carried by different particles and have greatly different strengths. But experiments show that at extremely short distances and at extremely high energies, the strengths of the forces begin to become more similar, as seen in [None](None).

As discussed earlier, the short ranges and large masses of the weak carrier bosons require correspondingly high energies to create them. Thus, the energy scale on the horizontal axis of [None](None) also corresponds to shorter and shorter distances (going from left to right), with 100 GeV corresponding to approximately 10<sup>−18</sup> m, for example. At that distance, the strengths of the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces are the same. To test this, energies of about 100 GeV are put into the system. When this occurs, the  <math>

<caption>The relative strengths of the four basic forces vary with distance, and, hence, energy is needed to probe small distances. At ordinary energies (a few eV or less), the forces differ greatly. However, at energies available in accelerators, the weak nuclear and electromagnetic (EM) forces become unified. Unfortunately, the energies at which the strong nuclear and electroweak forces become the same are unreachable in any conceivable accelerator. The universe may provide a laboratory, and nature may show effects at ordinary energies that give us clues about the validity of this graph.</caption>
The extremely short distances and high energies at which the electroweak force becomes identical with the strong nuclear force are not reachable with any conceivable human-built accelerator. At energies of about 10<sup>14</sup> GeV (16,000 J per particle), distances of about 10<sup>–30</sup> m can be probed. Such energies are needed to test the theory directly, but these are about 10<sup>10</sup> times higher than the maximum energy associated with the LHC, and the distances are about 10<sup>12</sup> smaller than any structure we have direct knowledge of. This would be the realm of various GUTs, of which there are many, since there is no constraining evidence at these energies and distances. Past experience has shown that anytime you probe so many orders of magnitude further, you find the unexpected.

While direct evidence of a GUT is not presently possible, that does not rule out the ability to assess a GUT through an indirect process. Current GUTs require various other events as a consequence of their theory. Some GUTs require the existence of magnetic monopoles, very massive individual north- and south-pole particles, which have not yet been proven to exist, while others require the use of extra dimensions. However, not all theories result in the same consequences. For example, disproving the existence of magnetic monopoles will not disprove all GUTs. Much of the science we accept in our everyday lives is based on different models, each with their own strengths and limitations. Although a particular model may have drawbacks, that does not necessarily mean that it should be discounted completely.

One consequence of GUTs that can theoretically be assessed is **proton decay**. Multiple current GUTs hypothesize that the stable proton should actually decay at a lifetime of 10<sup>31</sup> years. While this time is incredibly large (keep in mind that the age of the universe is less than 14 billion years), scientists at the **Super-Kamiokande** in Japan have used a 50,000-ton tank of water to search for its existence. The decay of a single proton in the Super-Kamiokande tank would be observed by a detector, thereby providing support for the predicting GUT model. However, as of 2014, 17 years into the experiment, decay is yet to be found. This time span equates to a minimum limit on proton life of  <math>

The Super-Kamiokande experiment is a clever use of proportional reasoning. Because it is not feasible to test for 10<sup>31</sup> years in order for a single proton to decay, scientists chose instead to manipulate the protontime ratio. If one proton decays in 10<sup>31</sup> years, then in one year 10<sup>−31</sup> protons will decay. With this in mind, if scientists wanted to test the proton decay theory in one year, they would need 10<sup>31</sup> protons. While this is also unfeasible, the use of a 50,000-ton tank of water helps to bring both the wait time and proton number to within reason.



### The Standard Model and the Big Bang

Nature is full of examples where the macroscopic and microscopic worlds intertwine. Newton realized that the nature of gravity on Earth that pulls an apple to the ground could explain the motion of the moon and planets so much farther away. Decays of tiny nuclei explain the hot interior of the Earth. Fusion of nuclei likewise explains the energy of stars. Today, the patterns in particle physics seem to be explaining the evolution and character of the universe. And the nature of the universe has implications for unexplored regions of particle physics.

In 1929, **Edwin Hubble** observed that all but the closest galaxies surrounding our own had a red shift in their hydrogen spectra that was proportional to their distance from us. Applying the Doppler Effect, Hubble recognized that this meant that all galaxies were receding from our own, with those farther away receding even faster. Knowing that our place in the universe was no more unique than any other, the implication was clear: The space within the universe itself was expanding. Just like pen marks on an expanding balloon, everything in the universe was accelerating away from everything else.

[None](None) shows how the recession of galaxies looks like the remnants of a gigantic explosion, the famous **Big Bang**. Extrapolating backward in time, the Big Bang would have occurred between 13 and 15 billion years ago, when all matter would have been at a single point. From this, questions instantly arise. What caused the explosion? What happened before the Big Bang? Was there a before, or did time start then? For our purposes, the biggest question relating to the Big Bang is this: How does the Big Bang relate to the unification of the fundamental forces?


<caption>Galaxies are flying apart from one another, with the more distant ones moving faster, as if a primordial explosion expelled the matter from which they formed. The most distant known galaxies move nearly at the speed of light relative to us.</caption>
To fully understand the conditions of the very early universe, recognize that as the universe contracts to the size of the Big Bang, changes will occur. The density and temperature of the universe will increase dramatically. As particles become closer together, they will become too close to exist as we know them. The high energies will create other, more unusual particles to exist in greater abundance. Knowing this, let’s move forward from the start of the universe, beginning with the Big Bang, as illustrated in [None](None).

<caption>The evolution of the universe from the Big Bang onward (from left to right) is intimately tied to the laws of physics, especially those of particle physics at the earliest stages. Theories of the unification of forces at high energies may be verified by their shaping of the universe and its evolution.</caption>

Additionally, quarks began to take form as energies decreased.

As the universe expanded, further eras took place, allowing for the existence of hadrons, leptons, and photons, the fundamental particles of the standard model. Eventually, in nucleosynthesis, nuclei would be able to form, and the basic building blocks of atomic matter could take place. Using particle accelerators, we are very much working backwards in an attempt to understand the universe. It is encouraging to see that the macroscopic conditions of the Big Bang align nicely with our submicroscopic particle theory.

### Performance Task

Communication is an often overlooked and useful skill for a scientist, especially in a competitive field where financial resources are limited. Scientists are often required to explain their findings or the relevance of their work to agencies within the government in order to maintain funding to continue their research. Let’s say you are an ambitious young particle physicist, heading an expensive project, and you need to justify its existence to the appropriate funding agency. Write a brief paper (about one page) explaining why molecular-level structure is important in the functioning of designed materials in a specific industry.

* First, think of an industry where molecular-level structure is important.
* Research what materials are used in that industry as well as what are the desired properties of the materials.
* What molecular-level characteristics lead to what properties?

One example would be explaining how flexible but durable materials are made up of long-chained molecules and how this is useful for finding more environmentally friendly alternatives to plastics. Another example is explaining why electrically conductive materials are often made of metal and how this is useful for developing better batteries.



### Test Prep Extended Response

If a Grand Unified Theory is proven and the four forces are unified, it will still be correct to say that the orbit of the Moon is determined by the gravitational force. Explain why.

1. Gravity will not be a property of the unified force.
2. Gravity will be one property of the unified force.
3. Apart from gravity, no other force depends on the mass of the object.
4. Apart from gravity, no other force can make an object move in a fixed orbit.

As the universe expanded and temperatures dropped, the strong nuclear force separated from the electroweak force. Is it likely that under cooler conditions, the force of electricity will separate from the force of magnetism?

1. No, the electric force relies on the magnetic force and vice versa.
2. Yes, the electric and magnetic forces can be separated from each other.
