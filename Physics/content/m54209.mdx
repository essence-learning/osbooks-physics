### Elastic and Inelastic Collisions

When objects collide, they can either stick together or bounce off one another, remaining separate. In this section, we’ll cover these two different types of **collisions**, first in one dimension and then in two dimensions. 

In an **elastic collision**, the objects separate after impact and don’t lose any of their **kinetic energy**. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion and is covered in detail elsewhere. The **law of conservation of momentum** is very useful here, and it can be used whenever the net external force on a system is zero. [None](None) shows an elastic collision where **momentum** is conserved.


<caption>The diagram shows a one-dimensional elastic collision between two objects.</caption>
An animation of an elastic collision between balls can be seen by watching this [video](https://openstax.org/l/28elasticball). It replicates the elastic collisions between balls of varying masses.

Perfectly elastic collisions can happen only with subatomic particles. Everyday observable examples of perfectly elastic collisions don’t exist—some kinetic energy is always lost, as it is converted into heat transfer due to friction. However, collisions between everyday objects are almost perfectly elastic when they occur with objects and surfaces that are nearly frictionless, such as with two steel blocks on ice.

Now, to solve problems involving one-dimensional elastic collisions between two objects, we can use the equation for conservation of momentum. First, the equation for conservation of momentum for two objects in a one-dimensional collision is

p1+p2=p′1+p′2(Fnet=0).Substituting the definition of momentum *p** = m**v* for each initial and final momentum, we get

m1v1+m2v2=m1v′1+m2v′2,where the primes (') indicate values after the collision; In some texts, you may see *i* for initial (before collision) and *f* for final (after collision). The equation assumes that the mass of each object does not change during the collision.

## Momentum: Ice Skater Throws a Ball
This video covers an elastic collision problem in which we find the *None* of an ice skater who throws a ball straight forward. To clarify, Sal is using the equation 

 mballVball+mskaterVskater=mballv′ball+mskaterv′skater .

Now, let us turn to the second type of collision. An **inelastic collision** is one in which kinetic energy is not conserved. A perfectly inelastic collision (also sometimes called completely or maximally inelastic) is one in which objects stick together after impact, and the maximum amount of kinetic energy is lost. This lack of conservation means that the forces between colliding objects may convert kinetic energy to other forms of energy, such as potential energy or thermal energy. The concepts of energy are discussed more thoroughly elsewhere. For inelastic collisions, kinetic energy may be lost in the form of heat. [None](None) shows an example of an inelastic collision. Two objects that have equal masses head toward each other at equal speeds and then stick together. The two objects come to rest after sticking together, conserving momentum but not kinetic energy after they collide. Some of the energy of motion gets converted to thermal energy, or heat.

(a) Two objects of equal mass initially head directly toward each other at the same speed. (b) The objects stick together, creating a perfectly inelastic collision. In the case shown in this figure, the combined objects stop; This is not true for all inelastic collisions.</caption>
Since the two objects stick together after colliding, they move together at the same speed. This lets us simplify the conservation of momentum equation from

m1v1+m2v2=m1v′1+m2v′2to

m1v1+m2v2= (m1+m2)v′for inelastic collisions, where *v*′ is the final velocity for both objects as they are stuck together, either in motion or at rest.

## Introduction to Momentum
This video reviews the definitions of momentum and impulse. It also covers an example of using conservation of momentum to solve a problem involving an inelastic collision between a car with constant velocity and a stationary truck. Note that Sal accidentally gives the unit for impulse as Joules; it is actually N ⋅ s or k ⋅ gm/s. 


How would the final velocity of the car-plus-truck system change if the truck had some initial velocity moving in the same direction as the car? What if the truck were moving in the opposite direction of the car initially? Why?

1. If the truck was initially moving in the same direction as the car, the final velocity would be greater. If the truck was initially moving in the opposite direction of the car, the final velocity would be smaller.
2. If the truck was initially moving in the same direction as the car, the final velocity would be smaller. If the truck was initially moving in the opposite direction of the car, the final velocity would be greater.
3. The direction in which the truck was initially moving would not matter. If the truck was initially moving in either direction, the final velocity would be smaller.
4. The direction in which the truck was initially moving would not matter. If the truck was initially moving in either direction, the final velocity would be greater.

Here’s a trick for remembering which collisions are elastic and which are inelastic: Elastic is a bouncy material, so when objects *bounce* off one another in the collision and separate, it is an elastic collision. When they don’t, the collision is inelastic.



### Solving Collision Problems

The Khan Academy videos referenced in this section show examples of elastic and inelastic collisions in one dimension. In one-dimensional collisions, the incoming and outgoing velocities are all along the same line. But what about collisions, such as those between billiard balls, in which objects scatter to the side? These are two-dimensional collisions, and just as we did with two-dimensional forces, we will solve these problems by first choosing a coordinate system and separating the motion into its *x* and *y* components.

One complication with two-dimensional collisions is that the objects might rotate before or after their collision. For example, if two ice skaters hook arms as they pass each other, they will spin in circles. We will not consider such rotation until later, and so for now, we arrange things so that no rotation is possible. To avoid rotation, we consider only the scattering of **point masses**—that is, structureless particles that cannot rotate or spin.

We start by assuming that *F*net = 0, so that momentum *p *is conserved. The simplest collision is one in which one of the particles is initially at rest. The best choice for a coordinate system is one with an axis parallel to the velocity of the incoming particle, as shown in [None](None). Because momentum is conserved, the components of momentum along the *x*- and *y*-axes, displayed as *p**None*and *p**None*, will also be conserved. With the chosen coordinate system, *p**None*is initially zero and *p**None*is the momentum of the incoming particle.


<caption>A two-dimensional collision with the coordinate system chosen so that </caption>
Now, we will take the conservation of momentum equation, *p*1 + *p*2 = *p*′1 + *p*′2  and break it into its *x* and *y* components.

Along the *x*-axis, the equation for conservation of momentum is

p1x+p2x=p′1x+p′2x.In terms of masses and velocities, this equation is

m1v1x+m2v2x=m1v′1x+m2v′2x.But because particle 2 is initially at rest, this equation becomes

m1v1x=m1v′1x+m2v′2x.The components of the velocities along the *x*-axis have the form *v* cos *θ *. Because particle 1 initially moves along the *x*-axis, we find *v*1*None*= *v*1. Conservation of momentum along the *x*-axis gives the equation

m1v1=m1v′1cosθ1+m2v′2cosθ2,where θ1 and θ2 are as shown in [None](None).

Along the *y*-axis, the equation for conservation of momentum is

p1y+p2y=p′1y+p′2y,or

m1v1y+m2v2y=m1v′1y+m2v′2y.But *v*1*y *is zero, because particle 1 initially moves along the *x*-axis. Because particle 2 is initially at rest, *v*2*y *is also zero. The equation for conservation of momentum along the *y*-axis becomes

0 =m1v′1y+m2v′2y.The components of the velocities along the *y*-axis have the form *v* sin  θ . Therefore, conservation of momentum along the *y*-axis gives the following equation:

0=m1v′1sinθ1+m2v′2sinθ2## Collision Lab
In this simulation, you will investigate collisions on an air hockey table. Place checkmarks next to the momentum vectors and momenta diagram options. Experiment with changing the masses of the balls and the initial speed of ball 1. How does this affect the momentum of each ball? What about the total momentum? Next, experiment with changing the elasticity of the collision. You will notice that collisions have varying degrees of elasticity, ranging from perfectly elastic to perfectly inelastic.  


If you wanted to maximize the velocity of ball 2 after impact, how would you change the settings for the masses of the balls, the initial speed of ball 1, and the elasticity setting? Why? HintPlacing a checkmark next to the velocity vectors and removing the momentum vectors will help you visualize the velocity of ball 2, and pressing the More Data button will let you take readings.

1. Maximize the mass of ball 1 and initial speed of ball 1; minimize the mass of ball 2; and set elasticity to 50 percent.
2. Maximize the mass of ball 2 and initial speed of ball 1; minimize the mass of ball 1; and set elasticity to 100 percent.
3. Maximize the mass of ball 1 and initial speed of ball 1; minimize the mass of ball 2; and set elasticity to 100 percent.
4. Maximize the mass of ball 2 and initial speed of ball 1; minimize the mass of ball 1; and set elasticity to 50 percent.

## Calculating Velocity: Inelastic Collision of a Puck and a Goalie
Find the recoil velocity of a 70 kg ice hockey goalie who catches a 0.150-kg hockey puck slapped at him at a velocity of 35 m/s. Assume that the goalie is at rest before catching the puck, and friction between the ice and the puck-goalie system is negligible (see [None](None)).


<caption>An ice hockey goalie catches a hockey puck and recoils backward in an inelastic collision.</caption>
## Strategy
Momentum is conserved because the net external force on the puck-goalie system is zero. Therefore, we can use conservation of momentum to find the final velocity of the puck and goalie system. Note that the initial velocity of the goalie is zero and that the final velocity of the puck and goalie are the same.

## Solution
For an inelastic collision, conservation of momentum is

m1v1+m2v2= (m1+m2)v′,where *v*′ is the velocity of both the goalie and the puck after impact. Because the goalie is initially at rest, we know *v*2 = 0. This simplifies the equation to 

m1v1= (m1+m2)v′.Solving for *v*′ yields

v′=(m1m1+m2)v1.Entering known values in this equation, we get

v′=(0.150kg70.0kg+0.150kg)(35m/s)=7.48×10−2m/s.## Discussion
This recoil velocity is small and in the same direction as the puck’s original velocity.

## Calculating Final Velocity: Elastic Collision of Two Carts 
Two hard, steel carts collide head-on and then ricochet off each other in opposite directions on a frictionless surface (see [None](None)). Cart 1 has a mass of 0.350 kg and an initial velocity of 2 m/s. Cart 2 has a mass of 0.500 kg and an initial velocity of −0.500 m/s. After the collision, cart 1 recoils with a velocity of −4 m/s. What is the final velocity of cart 2?


<caption>Two carts collide with each other in an elastic collision. </caption>
## Strategy
Since the track is frictionless, *F*net = 0 and we can use conservation of momentum to find the final velocity of cart 2.

## Solution
As before, the equation for conservation of momentum for a one-dimensional elastic collision in a two-object system is

m1v1+m2v2=m1v′1+m2v′2.The only unknown in this equation is *v*′2. Solving for *v*′2 and substituting known values into the previous equation yields

v′2=m1v1+m2v2−m1v′1m2=(0.350kg)(2.00m/s)+(0.500 kg)(−0.500 m/s)−(0.350kg)(−4.00m/s)0.500kg=3.70m/s.## Discussion
The final velocity of cart 2 is large and positive, meaning that it is moving to the right after the collision.

## Calculating Final Velocity in a Two-Dimensional Collision 
Suppose the following experiment is performed ([None](None)). An object of mass 0.250 kg (*m*1) is slid on a frictionless surface into a dark room, where it strikes an initially stationary object of mass 0.400 kg (*m*2). The 0.250 kg object emerges from the room at an angle of 45º with its incoming direction. The speed of the 0.250 kg object is originally 2 m/s and is 1.50 m/s after the collision. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the velocity (*v*′2 and  θ2 ) of the 0.400 kg object after the collision.


<caption>The incoming object of mass </caption>
## Strategy
Momentum is conserved because the surface is frictionless. We chose the coordinate system so that the initial velocity is parallel to the *x*-axis, and conservation of momentum along the *x*- and *y*-axes applies.

Everything is known in these equations except *v*′2 and *θ*2, which we need to find. We can find two unknowns because we have two independent equations—the equations describing the conservation of momentum in the *x *and *y *directions.

## Solution
First, we’ll solve both conservation of momentum equations ( m1v1=m1v′1cosθ1+m2v′2cosθ2  and   0=m1v′1sinθ1+m2v′2sinθ2 ) for *v*′2 sin   θ2 .

For conservation of momentum along x-axis, let’s substitute sin  θ2 /tan  θ2  for cos  θ2  so that terms may cancel out later on. This comes from rearranging the definition of the trigonometric identity tan  θ  = sin  θ /cos  θ . This gives us

m1v1=m1v′1cosθ1+m2v′2sinθ2tanθ2.Solving for *v*′2 sin θ2  yields

v′2sinθ2=(m1v1−m1v′1cosθ1)(tanθ2)m2.For conservation of momentum along *y*-axis, solving for *v*′2 sin  θ2  yields

v′2sinθ2=−(m1v′1sinθ1)m2.Since both equations equal *v*′2 sin  θ2, we can set them equal to one another, yielding

(m1v1−m1v′1cosθ1)(tanθ2)m2=−(m1v′1sinθ1)m2.Solving this equation for tan  θ2, we get

tanθ2=v′1sinθ1v′1cosθ1−v1.Entering known values into the previous equation gives

tanθ2=(1.50)(0.707)(1.50)(0.707)−2.00=−1.129.Therefore,

θ2=tan−1(−1.129)=3120.Since angles are defined as positive in the counterclockwise direction, *m*2 is scattered to the right. 

We’ll use the conservation of momentum along the y-axis equation to solve for *v*′2.

v′2=−m1m2v′1sinθ1sinθ2Entering known values into this equation gives

v′2=−(0.250)(0.400)(1.50)(0.7071−0.7485).Therefore,

v′2= 0.886 m/s.## Discussion
Either equation for the *x*- or *y*-axis could have been used to solve for *v*′2, but the equation for the *y*-axis is easier because it has fewer terms.

### Performance Task

You will need the following:

* balls of different weights
* a ruler or wooden strip
* some books
* a paper cup

Make an inclined plane by resting one end of a ruler on a stack of books. Place a paper cup on the other end. Roll a ball from the top of the ruler so that it hits the paper cup. Measure the displacement of the paper cup due to the collision. Now use increasingly heavier balls for this activity and see how that affects the displacement of the cup. Plot a graph of mass vs. displacement. Now repeat the same activity, but this time, instead of using different balls, change the incline of the ruler by varying the height of the stack of books. This will give you different velocities of the ball. See how this affects the displacement of the paper cup.
