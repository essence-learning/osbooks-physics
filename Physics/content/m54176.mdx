### Angle of Rotation

What exactly do we mean by *circular motion* or *rotation*? **Rotational motion** is the circular motion of an object about an axis of rotation. We will discuss specifically circular motion and spin. **Circular motion** is when an object moves in a circular path. Examples of circular motion include a race car speeding around a circular curve, a toy attached to a string swinging in a circle around your head, or the circular *loop-the-loop* on a roller coaster. **Spin** is rotation about an axis that goes through the center of mass of the object, such as Earth rotating on its axis, a wheel turning on its axle, the spin of a tornado on its path of destruction, or a figure skater spinning during a performance at the Olympics. Sometimes, objects will be spinning while in circular motion, like the Earth spinning on its axis while revolving around the Sun, but we will focus on these two motions separately.

When solving problems involving rotational motion, we use variables that are similar to linear variables (distance, velocity, acceleration, and force) but take into account the curvature or rotation of the motion. Here, we define the **angle of rotation**, which is the angular equivalence of distance; and **angular velocity**, which is the angular equivalence of linear velocity.

When objects rotate about some axis—for example, when the CD in [Figure 06 01 CD](Figure_06_01_CD) rotates about its center—each point in the object follows a circular path. 


<caption>All points on a CD travel in circular paths. The pits (dots) along a line from the center to the edge all move through the same angle  </caption>
The **arc length**, *Δ*, is the distance traveled along a circular path. The **radius of curvature**,* *, is the radius of the circular path. Both are shown in [Figure 06 01 RotationAngle](Figure_06_01_RotationAngle).


<caption>The radius (</caption>
Consider a line from the center of the CD to its edge. In a given time, each *pit* (used to record information) on this line moves through the same angle. The angle of rotation is the amount of rotation and is the angular analog of distance.

The angle of rotation is often measured by using a unit called the **radian**. (Radians are actually dimensionless, because a radian is defined as the ratio of two distances, radius and arc length.) A **revolution** is one complete rotation, where every point on the circle returns to its original position. One revolution covers  <math> <mrow>  <mn>2</mn><mi>π</mi> </mrow></math>  radians (or 360 degrees), and therefore has an angle of rotation of    radians (or 360 degrees), and therefore has an angle of rotation of  <math> <mrow>  <mn>2</mn><mi>π</mi> </mrow></math>  radians, and an arc length that is the same as the circumference of the circle. We can convert between radians, revolutions, and degrees using the relationship  radians, and an arc length that is the same as the circumference of the circle.

### Angular Velocity

How fast is an object rotating? We can answer this question by using the concept of angular velocity. Consider first the angular speed  <math>   <mrow>   <mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>ω</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo>  </mrow> </math>  is the rate at which the angle of rotation changes. In equation form, the angular speed is  is the rate at which the angle of rotation changes. In equation form, the angular speed is

<equation id="fs-id1164565533858"> <math> <mrow>  <mi>ω</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mrow>    <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>θ</mi>   </mrow>   <mrow>    <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>t</mi>   </mrow>  </mfrac>  <mtext>,</mtext> </mrow></math> </equation>
which means that an angular rotation  <math>   <mrow>   <mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>Δ</mi><mi>θ</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo>  </mrow> </math>  occurs in a time,    occurs in a time,  <math> <mrow>  <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>t</mi> </mrow></math> . If an object rotates through a greater angle of rotation in a given time, it has a greater angular speed. The units for angular speed are radians per second (rad/s). . If an object rotates through a greater angle of rotation in a given time, it has a greater angular speed. The units for angular speed are radians per second (rad/s).

Now let’s consider the direction of the angular speed, which means we now must call it the angular velocity. The direction of the angular velocity is along the axis of rotation. For an object rotating clockwise, the angular velocity points away from you along the axis of rotation. For an object rotating counterclockwise, the angular velocity points toward you along the axis of rotation.

Angular velocity (ω) is the angular version of linear velocity *v*. **Tangential velocity** is the instantaneous linear velocity of an object in rotational motion*. *To get the precise relationship between angular velocity and tangential velocity, consider again a pit on the rotating CD. This pit moves through an arc length  <math display="block">   <mrow>   <mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>Δ</mi><mi>s</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo>  </mrow> </math>  in a   in a *short* time  <math display="block">   <mrow>   <mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>Δ</mi><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo>  </mrow> </math>  so its tangential   so its tangential *speed* is

<equation id="eip-289"><label /> <math> <mrow>  <mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mrow>    <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>s</mi>   </mrow>   <mrow>    <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>t</mi>   </mrow>  </mfrac>  <mtext>.</mtext> </mrow></math> </equation>
From the definition of the angle of rotation,  <math> <mrow>  <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>θ</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mrow>    <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>s</mi>   </mrow>   <mi>r</mi>  </mfrac> </mrow></math>, we see that  , we see that  <math> <mrow>  <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>s</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>r</mi><mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>θ</mi> </mrow></math> . Substituting this into the expression for  . Substituting this into the expression for *v *gives

<equation id="fs-id1167065909764" class="unnumbered"><label /> <math> <mrow>  <mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mrow>    <mtext>r</mtext><mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>θ</mi>   </mrow>   <mrow>    <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>t</mi>   </mrow>  </mfrac>  <mo>=</mo><mi>r</mi><mi>ω</mi><mtext>.</mtext> </mrow></math></equation>
The equation  <math> <mrow>  <mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>r</mi><mi>ω</mi> </mrow></math>  says that the tangential speed   says that the tangential speed *v* is proportional to the distance *r* from the center of rotation. Consequently, tangential speed is greater for a point on the outer edge of the CD (with larger *r*) than for a point closer to the center of the CD (with smaller *r*). This makes sense because a point farther out from the center has to cover a longer arc length in the same amount of time as a point closer to the center. Note that both points will still have the same angular speed, regardless of their distance from the center of rotation. See [Figure 06 01 ArcLength](Figure_06_01_ArcLength).


<caption>Points 1 and 2 rotate through the same angle ( </caption>
Now, consider another example: the tire of a moving car (see [Figure 06 01 TireRotates](Figure_06_01_TireRotates)). The faster the tire spins, the faster the car moves—large  <math> <mi>ω</mi></math>  means large   means large *v* because  <math> <mrow>  <mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>r</mi><mi>ω</mi> </mrow></math> . Similarly, a larger-radius tire rotating at the same angular velocity,   . Similarly, a larger-radius tire rotating at the same angular velocity,  <math> <mstyle mathvariant="bold" mathsize="normal"><mi>ω</mi></mstyle></math>, will produce a greater linear (tangential) velocity, , will produce a greater linear (tangential) velocity, *v,* for the car. This is because a larger radius means a longer arc length must contact the road, so the car must move farther in the same amount of time.


<caption>A car moving at a velocity, </caption>
However, there are cases where linear velocity and tangential velocity are not equivalent, such as a car spinning its tires on ice. In this case, the linear velocity will be less than the tangential velocity. Due to the lack of friction under the tires of a car on ice, the arc length through which the tire treads move is greater than the linear distance through which the car moves. It’s similar to running on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bike; you are literally going nowhere fast.

Angular velocity *ω* and tangential velocity *v* are vectors, so we must include magnitude and direction. The direction of the angular velocity is along the axis of rotation, and points away from you for an object rotating clockwise, and toward you for an object rotating counterclockwise. In mathematics this is described by the right-hand rule. Tangential velocity is usually described as up, down, left, right, north, south, east, or west, as shown in [Figure 06 01 Vinyl](Figure_06_01_Vinyl).


<caption>As the fly on the edge of an old-fashioned vinyl record moves in a circle, its instantaneous velocity is always at a tangent to the circle. The direction of the angular velocity is into the page this case.</caption>

Now that we have an understanding of the concepts of angle of rotation and angular velocity, we’ll apply them to the real-world situations of a clock tower and a spinning tire.

## Angle of rotation at a Clock Tower
The clock on a clock tower has a radius of 1.0 m. (a) What angle of rotation does the hour hand of the clock travel through when it moves from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m.? (b) What’s the arc length along the outermost edge of the clock between the hour hand at these two times?

## Strategy
We can figure out the angle of rotation by multiplying a full revolution ( <math> <mrow>  <mn>2</mn><mi>π</mi> </mrow></math>  radians) by the fraction of the 12 hours covered by the hour hand in going from 12 to 3. Once we have the angle of rotation, we can solve for the arc length by rearranging the equation    radians) by the fraction of the 12 hours covered by the hour hand in going from 12 to 3. Once we have the angle of rotation, we can solve for the arc length by rearranging the equation  <math> <mrow>  <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>θ</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mrow>    <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>s</mi>   </mrow>   <mi>r</mi>  </mfrac> </mrow></math>  since the radius is given.  since the radius is given.

## Solution to (a)
In going from 12 to 3, the hour hand covers 1/4 of the 12 hours needed to make a complete revolution. Therefore, the angle between the hour hand at 12 and at 3 is  <math> <mrow>  <mfrac>   <mn>1</mn>   <mn>4</mn>  </mfrac>  <mo>×</mo><mn>2</mn><mspace width="0.3em" /><mtext>π</mtext><mi>rad</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mtext>π</mtext>   <mn>2</mn>  </mfrac> </mrow></math>  (i.e., 90 degrees).  (i.e., 90 degrees).

## Solution to (b)
Rearranging the equation

we get

<equation id="fs-id1164567422096"> <math> <mrow>  <mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>s</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>r</mi><mtext>Δ</mtext><mi>θ</mi><mtext>.</mtext> </mrow></math> </equation>
Inserting the known values gives an arc length of

## Discussion
We were able to drop the radians from the final solution to part (b) because radians are actually dimensionless. This is because the radian is defined as the ratio of two distances (radius and arc length). Thus, the formula gives an answer in units of meters, as expected for an arc length.

## How Fast Does a Car Tire Spin?
Calculate the angular speed of a 0.300 m radius car tire when the car travels at 15.0 m/s (about 54 km/h). See [Figure 06 01 TireRotates](Figure_06_01_TireRotates).

## Strategy
In this case, the speed of the tire tread with respect to the tire axle is the same as the speed of the car with respect to the road, so we have *v *= 15.0 m/s. The radius of the tire is *r *= 0.300 m. Since we know *v *and *r*, we can rearrange the equation  <math> <mrow>  <mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>r</mi><mi>ω</mi> </mrow></math>, to get  , to get  <math> <mrow>  <mi>ω</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mi>v</mi>   <mi>r</mi>  </mfrac> </mrow></math>  and find the angular speed.  and find the angular speed.

## Solution
To find the angular speed, we use the relationship:  <math> <mrow>  <mi>ω</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac>   <mi>v</mi>   <mi>r</mi>  </mfrac> </mrow></math> . .

Inserting the known quantities gives

## Discussion
When we cancel units in the above calculation, we get 50.0/s (i.e., 50.0 per second, which is usually written as 50.0 s<sup>−1</sup>). But the angular speed must have units of rad/s. Because radians are dimensionless, we can insert them into the answer for the angular speed because we know that the motion is circular. Also note that, if an earth mover with much larger tires, say 1.20 m in radius, were moving at the same speed of 15.0 m/s, its tires would rotate more slowly. They would have an angular speed of

What happens to tangential velocity as the radius of an object increases provided the angular velocity remains the same?

1. It increases because tangential velocity is directly proportional to the radius.
2. It increases because tangential velocity is inversely proportional to the radius.
3. It decreases because tangential velocity is directly proportional to the radius.
4. It decreases because tangential velocity is inversely proportional to the radius.
