### Simple Machines

**Simple machines** make work easier, but they do not decrease the amount of work you have to do. Why can’t simple machines change the amount of work that you do? Recall that in closed systems the total amount of energy is conserved. A machine cannot increase the amount of energy you put into it. So, why is a simple machine useful? Although it cannot change the amount of work you do, a simple machine can change the amount of force you must apply to an object, and the distance over which you apply the force. In most cases, a simple machine is used to reduce the amount of force you must exert to do work. The down side is that you must exert the force over a greater distance, because the product of force and distance, *f**d*, (which equals work) does not change.

Let’s examine how this works in practice. In [None](None)(a), the worker uses a type of **lever** to exert a small force over a large distance, while the pry bar pulls up on the nail with a large force over a small distance. [None](None)(b) shows the how a lever works mathematically. The effort force, applied at *F*, lifts the load (the resistance force) which is pushing down at *F**r*. The triangular pivot is called the **fulcrum**; the part of the lever between the fulcrum and *F**e* is the effort arm, *L*; and the part to the left is the resistance arm, *L*. The **mechanical advantage** is a number that tells us how many times a simple machine multiplies the effort force. The **ideal mechanical advantage**, *IMA*, is the mechanical advantage of a perfect machine with no loss of useful work caused by friction between moving parts. The equation for *IMA* is shown in [None](None)(b).


        <caption>(a) A pry bar is a type of lever. (b) The ideal mechanical advantage equals the length of the effort arm divided by the length of the resistance arm of a lever.</caption>
In general, the *IMA* = the resistance force, *F**r*, divided by the effort force, *F**e*.* IMA* also equals the distance over which the effort is applied, *d*, divided by the distance the load travels, *d*.

IMA=FrFe=dedrGetting back to conservation of energy, for any simple machine, the work put into the machine, *W*, equals the work the machine puts out, *W*. Combining this with the information in the paragraphs above, we can write 

Wi=WoFede=FrdrIf  Fe<Fr, then de>dr.The equations show how a simple machine can output the same amount of work while reducing the amount of effort force by increasing the distance over which the effort force is applied.

## Introduction to Mechanical Advantage 
This video shows how to calculate the *IMA* of a lever by three different methods: (1) from effort force and resistance force; (2) from the lengths of the lever arms, and; (3) from the distance over which the force is applied and the distance the load moves.


        
            [None](#ost/api/ex/k12phys-ch09-ex040)
          

Some levers exert a large force to a short effort arm. This results in a smaller force acting over a greater distance at the end of the resistance arm. Examples of this type of lever are baseball bats, hammers, and golf clubs. In another type of lever, the fulcrum is at the end of the lever and the load is in the middle, as in the design of a wheelbarrow.

The simple machine shown in [None](None) is called a **wheel and axle***.* It is actually a form of lever. The difference is that the effort arm can rotate in a complete circle around the fulcrum, which is the center of the axle. Force applied to the outside of the wheel causes a greater force to be applied to the rope that is wrapped around the axle. As shown in the figure, the ideal mechanical advantage is calculated by dividing the radius of the wheel by the radius of the axle. Any crank-operated device is an example of a wheel and axle.


        <caption>Force applied to a wheel exerts a force on its axle.</caption>
An **inclined plane** and a **wedge** are two forms of the same simple machine. A wedge is simply two inclined planes back to back. [None](None) shows the simple formulas for calculating the *IMA*s of these machines. All sloping, paved surfaces for walking or driving are inclined planes. Knives and axe heads are examples of wedges.


        <caption>An inclined plane is shown on the left, and a wedge is shown on the right.</caption>
The **screw** shown in [None](None) is actually a lever attached to a circular inclined plane. Wood screws (of course) are also examples of screws. The lever part of these screws is a screw driver. In the formula for *IMA*, the distance between screw threads is called *pitch* and has the symbol *P*. 


        <caption>The screw shown here is used to lift very heavy objects, like the corner of a car or a house a short distance.</caption>
[None](None) shows three different **pulley** systems. Of all simple machines, mechanical advantage is easiest to calculate for pulleys. Simply count the number of ropes supporting the load. That is the *IMA*. Once again we have to exert force over a longer distance to multiply force. To raise a load 1 meter with a pulley system you have to pull *N* meters of rope. Pulley systems are often used to raise flags and window blinds and are part of the mechanism of construction cranes.


        <caption>Three pulley systems are shown here.</caption>
## Mechanical Advantage of Inclined Planes and Pulleys
The first part of this video shows how to calculate the *IMA* of pulley systems. The last part shows how to calculate the *IMA* of an inclined plane. 


        How could you use a pulley system to lift a light load to great height?

1. Reduce the radius of the pulley.
2. Increase the number of pulleys.
3. Decrease the number of ropes supporting the load.
4. Increase the number of ropes supporting the load.

A **complex machine** is a combination of two or more simple machines. The wire cutters in [None](None) combine two levers and two wedges. Bicycles include wheel and axles, levers, screws, and pulleys. Cars and other vehicles are combinations of many machines.


        <caption>Wire cutters are a common complex machine.</caption>


### Calculating Mechanical Advantage and Efficiency of Simple Machines

In general, the *IMA* = the resistance force, *F*r, divided by the effort force, *F*e. *IMA* also equals the distance over which the effort is applied, *d*, divided by the distance the load travels, *d*.

IMA=FrFe=dedrRefer back to the discussions of each simple machine for the specific equations for the *IMA* for each type of machine.

No simple or complex machines have the actual mechanical advantages calculated by the *IMA* equations. In real life, some of the applied work always ends up as wasted heat due to friction between moving parts. Both the **input work** (*W*) and **output work** (*W*) are the result of a force, *F*, acting over a distance, *d*.

Wi=FidiandWo=FodoThe **efficiency output** of a machine is simply the output work divided by the input work, and is usually multiplied by 100 so that it is expressed as a percent.

% efficiency=WoWi×100Look back at the pictures of the simple machines and think about which would have the highest efficiency. Efficiency is related to friction, and friction depends on the smoothness of surfaces and on the area of the surfaces in contact. How would lubrication affect the efficiency of a simple machine?

## Efficiency of a Lever
The input force of 11 N acting on the effort arm of a lever moves 0.4 m, which lifts a 40 N weight resting on the resistance arm a distance of 0.1 m. What is the efficiency of the machine?
          

## Strategy
State the equation for efficiency of a simple machine,  % efficiency=WoWi×100,  and calculate *W* and *W*.  Both work values are the product *Fd*.

## Solution
 Wi=Fidi  = (11)(0.4) = 4.4 J and  Wo=Fodo  = (40)(0.1) = 4.0 J, then  % efficiency=WoWi×100=4.04.4×100=91%  

## Discussion
Efficiency in real machines will always be less than 100 percent because of work that is converted to unavailable heat by friction and air resistance. *W* and *W* can always be calculated as a force multiplied by a distance, although these quantities are not always as obvious as they are in the case of a lever.



### Practice Problems


          [None](#ost/api/ex/k12phys-ch09-ex043)
        

If a pulley system can lift a 200N load with an effort force of 52 N and has an efficiency of almost 100 percent, how many ropes are supporting the load?

1. 1 rope is required because the actual mechanical advantage is 0.26.
2. 1 rope is required because the actual mechanical advantage is 3.80.
3. 4 ropes are required because the actual mechanical advantage is 0.26.
4. 4 ropes are required because the actual mechanical advantage is 3.80.



### Check Your Understanding

2. 0.17 cm
3. 3.0 cm
4. 6.0 cm

### Performance Task

Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer; Cause and Effect; and S&EP, Planning and Carrying Out Investigations

Plan an investigation to measure the mechanical advantage of simple machines and compare to the *IMA* of the machine. Also measure the efficiency of each machine studied. Design an investigation to make these measurements for these simple machines: lever, inclined plane, wheel and axle and a pulley system. In addition to these machines, include a spring scale, a tape measure, and a weight with a loop on top that can be attached to the hook on the spring scale. A spring scale is shown in the image.


        A spring scale measures weight, not mass.

LEVER: Beginning with the lever, explain how you would measure input force, output force, effort arm, and resistance arm. Also explain how you would find the distance the load travels and the distance over which the effort force is applied. Explain how you would use this data to determine *IMA* and efficiency.

INCLINED PLANE: Make measurements to determine *IMA* and efficiency of an inclined plane. Explain how you would use the data to calculate these values. Which property do you already know? Note that there are no effort and resistance arm measurements, but there are height and length measurements.

WHEEL AND AXLE: Again, you will need two force measurements and four distance measurements. Explain how you would use these to calculate *IMA* and efficiency.

SCREW: You will need two force measurements, two distance traveled measurements, and two length measurements. You may describe a screw like the one shown in [None](None) or you could use a screw and screw driver. (Measurements would be easier for the former). Explain how you would use these to calculate *IMA* and efficiency.

PULLEY SYSTEM: Explain how you would determine the *IMA* and efficiency of the four-pulley system shown in [None](None). Why do you only need two distance measurements for this machine?

Design a table that compares the efficiency of the five simple machines. Make predictions as to the most and least efficient machines.
