### Mechanical Energy and Conservation of Energy

We saw earlier that mechanical energy can be either potential or kinetic. In this section we will see how energy is transformed from one of these forms to the other. We will also see that, in a closed system, the sum of these forms of energy remains constant.

Quite a bit of potential energy is gained by a roller coaster car and its passengers when they are raised to the top of the first hill. Remember that the *potential* part of the term means that energy has been stored and can be used at another time. You will see that this stored energy can either be used to do work or can be transformed into kinetic energy. For example, when an object that has gravitational potential energy falls, its energy is converted to kinetic energy. Remember that both work and energy are expressed in joules.

Refer back to [None](None). The amount of work required to raise the TV from point A to point B is equal to the amount of gravitational potential energy the TV gains from its height above the ground. This is generally true for any object raised above the ground. If all the work done on an object is used to raise the object above the ground, the amount work equals the object’s gain in gravitational potential energy. However, note that because of the work done by friction, these energy–work transformations are never perfect. Friction causes the loss of some useful energy. In the discussions to follow, we will use the approximation that transformations are frictionless.

Now, let’s look at the roller coaster in [None](None). Work was done on the roller coaster to get it to the top of the first rise; at this point, the roller coaster has gravitational potential energy. It is moving slowly, so it also has a small amount of kinetic energy. As the car descends the first slope, its *PE* is converted to *KE*. At the low point much of the original *PE* has been transformed to *KE*, and speed is at a maximum. As the car moves up the next slope, some of the *KE* is transformed back into *PE* and the car slows down.


<caption>During this roller coaster ride, there are conversions between potential and kinetic energy.</caption>
## Energy Skate Park Basics
This simulation shows how kinetic and potential energy are related, in a scenario similar to the roller coaster. Observe the changes in *KE* and *PE* by clicking on the bar graph boxes. Also try the three differently shaped skate parks. Drag the skater to the track to start the animation.

On an actual roller coaster, there are many ups and downs, and each of these is accompanied by transitions between kinetic and potential energy. Assume that no energy is lost to friction. At any point in the ride, the total mechanical energy is the same, and it is equal to the energy the car had at the top of the first rise. This is a result of the **law of conservation of energy**, which says that, in a closed system, total energy is conservedthat is, it is constant. Using subscripts 1 and 2 to represent initial and final energy, this law is expressed as

KE1+PE1=KE2+PE2.Either side equals the total mechanical energy. The phrase *in a ***** means we are assuming no energy is lost to the surroundings due to friction and air resistance. If we are making calculations on dense falling objects, this is a good assumption. For the roller coaster, this assumption introduces some inaccuracy to the calculation.



### Calculations involving Mechanical Energy and Conservation of Energy

When calculating work or energy, use units of meters for distance, newtons for force, kilograms for mass, and seconds for time. This will assure that the result is expressed in joules.

## Conservation of Energy
This video discusses conversion of *PE* to *KE* and conservation of energy. The scenario is very similar to the roller coaster and the skate park. It is also a good explanation of the energy changes studied in the snap lab.

## Applying the Law of Conservation of Energy
A 10 kg rock falls from a 20 m cliff. What is the kinetic and potential energy when the rock has fallen 10 m?

## Strategy
Choose the equation.

KE1+PE1=KE2+PE2
          

KE=12mv2; PE=mgh
          

12mv12+mgh1=12mv22+mgh2
          

List the knowns.

*m* = 10 kg, *v*1 = 0, *g* = 9.80

ms2,*h*1 = 20 m, *h*2 = 10 m 

Identify the unknowns.

*KE*2 and *PE*2

Substitute the known values into the equation and solve for the unknown variables.

## Solution
PE2=mgh2=10(9.80)10=980 J
            

KE2=PE2−(KE1+PE1)=980−{[0−[10(9.80)20]]}=980 J
            

## Discussion
Alternatively, conservation of energy equation could be solved for *v*2 and *KE*2 could be calculated. Note that *m* could also be eliminated.

Note that we can solve many problems involving conversion between *KE* and *PE* without knowing the mass of the object in question. This is because kinetic and potential energy are both proportional to the mass of the object. In a situation where *KE* = *PE*, we know that *m**g**h* = (1/2)*m**v*<sup>2</sup>.

Dividing both sides by *m* and rearranging, we have the relationship 

2*g**h* = *v*<sup>2</sup>.



### Practice Problems

1. 0 J
2. 100 J
3. 300 J
4. 900 J

A 0.2 kg apple on an apple tree has a potential energy of 10 J. It falls to the ground, converting all of its PE to kinetic energy. What is the velocity of the apple just before it hits the ground?

1. 0 m/s
2. 2 m/s
3. 10 m/s
4. 50 m/s

The starting line of a cross country foot race is at the bottom of a hill. Which form(s) of mechanical energy of the runners will change when the starting gun is fired?

1. Kinetic energy only
2. Potential energy only
3. Both kinetic and potential energy
4. Neither kinetic nor potential energy



### Critical Thinking

True or falseA cyclist coasts down one hill and up another hill until she comes to a stop. The point at which the bicycle stops is lower than the point at which it started coasting because part of the original potential energy has been converted to a quantity of heat and this makes the tires of the bicycle warm.

1. True
2. False

The potential energy stored in a compressed spring is  U=12kx2, where *k* is the force constant and *x* is the distance the spring is compressed from the equilibrium position. Four experimental setups described below can be used to determine the force constant of a spring. Which one(s) require measurement of the fewest number of variables to determine *k*? Assume the acceleration due to gravity is known.

1. An object is propelled vertically by a compressed spring.
2. An object is propelled horizontally on a frictionless surface by a compressed spring.
3. An object is statically suspended from a spring.
4. An object suspended from a spring is set into oscillatory motion.

1. I only
2. III only
3. I and II only
4. III and IV only

The correct answer is (d), which features two setups where two quantities must be measured to find the spring constant. The period of an object suspended from a spring is determined by the mass of the object and the spring constant  (T=2πm/k), so only the mass and period need to be measured to find the force constant, *k*. The distance *x* a spring stretches when an object is suspended from it can be determined by the equation  mg=kx, so only the mass and the distance need to be measured to find *k*. The remaining two arrangements require measurement of three quantities: the mass and a displacement plus either a height or a speed, since (I) is described by the equation  mgh=12kx2  and (II) is described by the equation  12kx2=12mv2 .

### Test Prep Extended Response

Acceleration due to gravity on the moon is 1.6 m/s<sup>2</sup> or about 16% of the value of *g* on Earth.
 If an astronaut on the moon threw a moon rock to a height of 7.8 m, what would be its velocity as it struck the
moons surface?
 How would the fact that the moon has no atmosphere affect the velocity of the falling moon rock? Explain your
answer.

1. The velocity of the rock as it hits the ground would be 5.0 m/s. Due to the lack of air friction, there would be complete transformation of the potential energy into the kinetic energy as the rock hits the moons surface.
2. The velocity of the rock as it hits the ground would be 5.0 m/s. Due to the lack of air friction, there would be incomplete transformation of the potential energy into the kinetic energy as the rock hits the moons surface.
3. The velocity of the rock as it hits the ground would be 12 m/s. Due to the lack of air friction, there would be complete transformation of the potential energy into the kinetic energy as the rock hits the moons surface.
4. The velocity of the rock as it hits the ground would be 12 m/s. Due to the lack of air friction, there would be incomplete transformation of the potential energy into the kinetic energy as the rock hits the moons surface.
