### Properties of Projectile Motion

**Projectile motion** is the motion of an object thrown (projected) into the air when, after the initial force that launches the object, air resistance is negligible and the only other force that object experiences is the force of gravity. The object is called a **projectile**, and its path is called its **trajectory**. **Air resistance** is a frictional force that slows its motion and can significantly alter the trajectory of the motion. Due to the difficulty in calculation, only situations in which the deviation from projectile motion is negligible and air resistance can be ignored are considered in introductory physics. That approximation is often quite accurate.

The most important concept in projectile motion is that when air resistance is ignored, *horizontal and vertical motions are* ****, meaning that they don’t influence one another. [None](None) compares a cannonball in free fall (in blue) to a cannonball launched horizontally in projectile motion (in red). You can see that the cannonball in free fall falls at the same rate as the cannonball in projectile motion. Keep in mind that if the cannon launched the ball with any vertical component to the velocity, the vertical displacements would not line up perfectly.

Since vertical and horizontal motions are independent, we can analyze them separately, along perpendicular axes. To do this, we separate projectile motion into the two components of its motion, one along the horizontal axis and the other along the vertical.


        <caption>The diagram shows the projectile motion of a cannonball shot at a horizontal angle versus one dropped with no horizontal velocity. Note that both cannonballs have the same vertical position over time.</caption>
We’ll call the horizontal axis the *x*-axis and the vertical axis the *y*-axis. For notation, *d* is the total displacement, and *x* and *y* are its components along the horizontal and vertical axes. The magnitudes of these vectors are *x* and *y*, as illustrated in [None](None).


        <caption>A boy kicks a ball at angle </caption>
As usual, we use velocity, acceleration, and displacement to describe motion. We must also find the components of these variables along the *x*- and *y*-axes. The components of acceleration are then very simple *a* = –*g* = –9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup>. Note that this definition defines the upwards direction as positive. Because gravity is vertical, *a* = 0. Both accelerations are constant, so we can use the kinematic equations. For review, the kinematic equations from a previous chapter are summarized in [None](None).

For problems of projectile motion, it is important to set up a coordinate system. The first step is to choose an initial position for  x  and  y . Usually, it is simplest to set the initial position of the object so that  x0=0  and  y0=0 .

## A Fireworks Projectile Explodes High and Away
During a fireworks display like the one illustrated in [None](None), a shell is shot into the air with an initial speed of 70.0 m/s at an angle of 75° above the horizontal. The fuse is timed to ignite the shell just as it reaches its highest point above the ground. (a) Calculate the height at which the shell explodes. (b) How much time passed between the launch of the shell and the explosion? (c) What is the horizontal displacement of the shell when it explodes?


              <caption>The diagram shows the trajectory of a fireworks shell.</caption>
## Strategy
The motion can be broken into horizontal and vertical motions in which ax=0 and  ay=g . We can then define x0 and y0 to be zero and solve for the **maximum height**.

## Solution for (a)
By height we mean the altitude or vertical position  y above the starting point. The highest point in any trajectory, the maximum height, is reached when  vy=0; this is the moment when the vertical velocity switches from positive (upwards) to negative (downwards). Since we know the initial velocity, initial position, and the value of *v*y when the firework reaches its maximum height, we use the following equation to find y 

vy2=v0y2−2g(y−y0).Because  y0 and  vy are both zero, the equation simplifies to

0=v0y2−2gy.Solving for  y gives

y=v0y22g.Now we must find  v0y, the component of the initial velocity in the *y*-direction. It is given by  v0y=v0sinθ, where  v0y is the initial velocity of 70.0 m/s, and θ=75∘ is the initial angle. Thus,

v0y=v0sinθ0=(70.0 m/s)(sin75∘)=67.6 m/sand  y is

y=(67.6 m/s)22(9.80 m/s2),so that

y=233 m.## Discussion for (a)
Since up is positive, the initial velocity and maximum height are positive, but the acceleration due to gravity is negative. The maximum height depends only on the vertical component of the initial velocity. The numbers in this example are reasonable for large fireworks displays, the shells of which do reach such heights before exploding.



## Solution for (b)
There is more than one way to solve for the time to the highest point. In this case, the easiest method is to use y=y0+12(v0y+vy)t   . Because  y0 is zero, this equation reduces to

y=12(v0y+vy)t.Note that the final vertical velocity,  vy, at the highest point is zero. Therefore,

t=2y(v0y+vy)=2(233 m)(67.6 m/s)=6.90 s.## Discussion for (b)
This time is also reasonable for large fireworks. When you are able to see the launch of fireworks, you will notice several seconds pass before the shell explodes. Another way of finding the time is by using y=y0+v0yt−12gt2, and solving the quadratic equation for t .



## Solution for (c)
Because air resistance is negligible,  ax=0 and the horizontal velocity is constant. The horizontal displacement is horizontal velocity multiplied by time as given by  x=x0+vxt, where  x0 is equal to zero

x=vxt,where  vx is the *x*-component of the velocity, which is given by  vx=v0cosθ0. Now,

vx=v0cosθ0=(70.0 m/s)(cos75∘)=18.1 m/s.The time  t for both motions is the same, and so  x is

x=(18.1 m/s)(6.90 s)=125 m.## Discussion for (c)
The horizontal motion is a constant velocity in the absence of air resistance. The horizontal displacement found here could be useful in keeping the fireworks fragments from falling on spectators. Once the shell explodes, air resistance has a major effect, and many fragments will land directly below, while some of the fragments may now have a velocity in the –x direction due to the forces of the explosion.

The expression we found for  y while solving part (a) of the previous problem works for any projectile motion problem where air resistance is negligible. Call the maximum height  y=h; then,

h=v0y22g.This equation defines the **maximum height of a projectile**. The maximum height depends only on the vertical component of the initial velocity.

## Calculating Projectile Motion: Hot Rock Projectile
Suppose a large rock is ejected from a volcano, as illustrated in [None](None), with a speed of 25.0 m/s and at an angle 35° above the horizontal. The rock strikes the side of the volcano at an altitude 20.0 m lower than its starting point. (a) Calculate the time it takes the rock to follow this path.


              <caption>The diagram shows the projectile motion of a large rock from a volcano.</caption>
## Strategy
Breaking this two-dimensional motion into two independent one-dimensional motions will allow us to solve for the time. The time a projectile is in the air depends only on its vertical motion.

## Solution
While the rock is in the air, it rises and then falls to a final position 20.0 m lower than its starting altitude. We can find the time for this by using

y=y0+v0yt−12gt2.If we take the initial position  y0 to be zero, then the final position is  y=−20.0 m. Now the initial vertical velocity is the vertical component of the initial velocity, found from

v0y=v0sinθ0=(25.0 m/s)(sin35∘)=14.3 m/s.Substituting known values yields

−20.0 m=(14.3 m/s)t−(4.90 m/s2)t2.Rearranging terms gives a quadratic equation in t 

(4.90 m/s2)t2−(14.3 m/s)t−(20.0 m)=0.This expression is a quadratic equation of the form at2+bt+c=0, where the constants are *a* = 4.90, *b* = –14.3, and *c* = –20.0. Its solutions are given by the quadratic formula

t=−b±b2−4ac2a.This equation yields two solutions *t* = 3.96 and *t* = –1.03. You may verify these solutions as an exercise. The time is t = 3.96 s or –1.03 s. The negative value of time implies an event before the start of motion, so we discard it. Therefore,

t=3.96 s.## Discussion
The time for projectile motion is completely determined by the vertical motion. So any projectile that has an initial vertical velocity of 14.3m/s and lands 20.0 m below its starting altitude will spend 3.96 s in the air.

The fact that vertical and horizontal motions are independent of each other lets us predict the range of a projectile. The *range* is the horizontal distance *R* traveled by a projectile on level ground, as illustrated in [None](None). Throughout history, people have been interested in finding the range of projectiles for practical purposes, such as aiming cannons.


        <caption>Trajectories of projectiles on level ground. (a) The greater the initial speed </caption>
How does the initial velocity of a projectile affect its range? Obviously, the greater the initial speed v0, the greater the range, as shown in the figure above. The initial angle θ0 also has a dramatic effect on the range. When air resistance is negligible, the range R of a projectile on *level ground* is

R=v02sin2θ0g,where v0 is the initial speed and θ0 is the initial angle relative to the horizontal. It is important to note that the range doesn’t apply to problems where the initial and final y position are different, or to cases where the object is launched perfectly horizontally.

## Projectile Motion
In this simulation you will learn about projectile motion by blasting objects out of a cannon. You can choose between objects such as a tank shell, a golf ball or even a Buick. Experiment with changing the angle, initial speed, and mass, and adding in air resistance. Make a game out of this simulation by trying to hit the target.
