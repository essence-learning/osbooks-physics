## Introduction
![Temp alt text](__MEDIA_URL__CNX_HSPhysics_06_00_RaceCar.jpg)<p>This Australian Grand Prix Formula 1 race car moves in a circular path as it makes the turn. Its wheels also spin rapidly. The same physical principles are involved in both of these motions. (Richard Munckton).</p>
You may recall learning about various aspects of motion along a straight line: kinematics (where we learned about displacement, velocity, and acceleration), projectile motion (a special case of two-dimensional kinematics), force, and Newton’s laws of motion. In some ways, this chapter is a continuation of Newton’s laws of motion. Recall that Newton’s first law tells us that objects move along a straight line at constant speed unless a net external force acts on them. Therefore, if an object moves along a circular path, such as the car in the photo, it must be experiencing an external force. In this chapter, we explore both circular motion and rotational motion.
