### The Work–Energy Theorem

In physics, the term **work** has a very specific definition. Work is application of force,  f, to move an object over a distance, *d*, in the direction that the force is applied. Work, *W*, is described by the equation

W=fd.Some things that we typically consider to be work are not work in the scientific sense of the term. Let’s consider a few examples. Think about why each of the following statements is true.

* *is not*
* *is*
* *is not*

The first two examples are fairly simple. Homework is not work because objects are not being moved over a distance. Lifting a rock up off the ground is work because the rock is moving in the direction that force is applied. The last example is less obvious. Recall from the laws of motion that force is *not *required to move an object at constant velocity. Therefore, while some force may be applied to keep the rock up off the ground, no net force is applied to keep the rock moving forward at constant velocity.

Work and **energy** are closely related. When you do work to move an object, you change the object’s energy. You (or an object) also expend energy to do work. In fact, energy can be defined as the ability to do work. Energy can take a variety of different forms, and one form of energy can transform to another. In this chapter we will be concerned with **mechanical energy**, which comes in two forms: **kinetic energy** and **potential energy**.

* Kinetic energy is also called energy of motion. A moving object has kinetic energy.
* **Gravitational potential energy**

Let’s examine how doing work on an object changes the object’s energy. If we apply force to lift a rock off the ground, we increase the rock’s potential energy, *PE*. If we drop the rock, the force of gravity increases the rock’s kinetic energy as the rock moves downward until it hits the ground.

The force we exert to lift the rock is equal to its weight, *w*, which is equal to its mass, *m*, multiplied by acceleration due to gravity, *g*.

f=w=mgThe work we do on the rock equals the force we exert multiplied by the distance, *d*, that we lift the rock. The work we do on the rock also equals the rock’s gain in gravitational potential energy, *PE*.

W=PEe=mgdKinetic energy depends on the mass of an object and its velocity, *v*.

KE=12mv2When we drop the rock the force of gravity causes the rock to fall, giving the rock kinetic energy. When work done on an object increases only its kinetic energy, then the net work equals the change in the value of the quantity 12mv2 . This is a statement of the **work–energy theorem**, which is expressed mathematically as

W=ΔKE = 12mv22−12mv12.The subscripts 2 and 1 indicate the final and initial velocity, respectively. This theorem was proposed and successfully tested by James Joule, shown in [None](None).

Does the name Joule sound familiar? The **joule** (J) is the metric unit of measurement for both work and energy. The measurement of work and energy with the same unit reinforces the idea that work and energy are related and can be converted into one another. 1.0 J = 1.0 N∙m, the units of force multiplied by distance. 1.0 N = 1.0 kg∙m/s<sup>2</sup>, so 1.0 J = 1.0 kg∙m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>. Analyzing the units of the term (1/2)*m**v*<sup>2</sup> will produce the same units for joules.

## Work and Energy
This video explains the work energy theorem and discusses how work done on an object increases the object’s KE.


True or falseThe energy increase of an object acted on only by a gravitational force is equal to the product of the object's weight and the distance the object falls.

1. True
2. False



### Calculations Involving Work and Power

In applications that involve work, we are often interested in how fast the work is done. For example, in roller coaster design, the amount of time it takes to lift a roller coaster car to the top of the first hill is an important consideration. Taking a half hour on the ascent will surely irritate riders and decrease ticket sales. Let’s take a look at how to calculate the time it takes to do work.

Recall that a rate can be used to describe a quantity, such as work, over a period of time. **Power** is the rate at which work is done. In this case, rate means *per unit of time*. Power is calculated by dividing the work done by the time it took to do the work.

P=WtLet’s consider an example that can help illustrate the differences among work, force, and power. Suppose the woman in [None](None) lifting the TV with a pulley gets the TV to the fourth floor in two minutes, and the man carrying the TV up the stairs takes five minutes to arrive at the same place. They have done the same amount of work  (fd)  on the TV, because they have moved the same mass over the same vertical distance, which requires the same amount of upward force. However, the woman using the pulley has generated more power. This is because she did the work in a shorter amount of time, so the denominator of the power formula, *t*, is smaller. (For simplicity’s sake, we will leave aside for now the fact that the man climbing the stairs has also done work on himself.)


<caption>No matter how you move a TV to the fourth floor, the amount of work performed and the potential energy gain are the same.</caption>
Power can be expressed in units of **watts** (W). This unit can be used to measure power related to any form of energy or work. You have most likely heard the term used in relation to electrical devices, especially light bulbs. Multiplying power by time gives the amount of energy. Electricity is sold in kilowatt-hours because that equals the amount of electrical energy consumed.

The watt unit was named after James Watt (1736–1819) (see [None](None)). He was a Scottish engineer and inventor who discovered how to coax more power out of steam engines.

## Watt’s Steam Engine
James Watt did not invent the steam engine, but by the time he was finished tinkering with it, it was more useful. The first steam engines were not only inefficient, they only produced a back and forth, or **reciprocal**, motion. This was natural because pistons move in and out as the pressure in the chamber changes. This limitation was okay for simple tasks like pumping water or mashing potatoes, but did not work so well for moving a train. Watt was able build a steam engine that converted reciprocal motion to circular motion. With that one innovation, the industrial revolution was off and running. The world would never be the same. One of Watt's steam engines is shown in [None](None). The video that follows the figure explains the importance of the steam engine in the industrial revolution.

## Watt's Role in the Industrial Revolution

Which form of mechanical energy does the steam engine generate?

1. Potential energy
2. Kinetic energy
3. Nuclear energy
4. Solar energy

Before proceeding, be sure you understand the distinctions among force, work, energy, and power. Force exerted on an object over a distance does work. Work can increase energy, and energy can do work. Power is the rate at which work is done.

## Applying the Work–Energy Theorem
An ice skater with a mass of 50 kg is gliding across the ice at a speed of 8 m/s when her friend comes up from behind and gives her a push, causing her speed to increase to 12 m/s. How much work did the friend do on the skater?

## Strategy
The work–energy theorem can be applied to the problem. Write the equation for the theorem and simplify it if possible.

W=ΔKE = 12mv22−12mv12Simplify to W=12m(v22−v12)## Solution
Identify the variables.
*m* = 50 kg,

v2=12ms, andv1=8msSubstitute. W=1250(122−82)=2,000 J

## Discussion
Work done on an object or system increases its energy. In this case, the increase is to the skater’s kinetic energy. It follows that the increase in energy must be the difference in KE before and after the push.

This problem illustrates a general technique for approaching problems that require you to apply formulas: Identify the unknown and the known variables, express the unknown variables in terms of the known variables, and then enter all the known values.
