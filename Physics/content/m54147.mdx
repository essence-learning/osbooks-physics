### Components of Vectors

For the **analytical method** of vector addition and subtraction, we use some simple geometry and trigonometry, instead of using a ruler and protractor as we did for graphical methods. However, the graphical method will still come in handy to visualize the problem by drawing vectors using the head-to-tail method. The analytical method is more accurate than the graphical method, which is limited by the precision of the drawing. For a refresher on the definitions of the sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle, see [None](None).


        <caption>For a right triangle, the sine, cosine, and tangent of </caption>
Since, by definition,  cosθ=x/h, we can find the length *x* if we know *h* and  θ  by using  x=hcosθ . Similarly, we can find the length of *y* by using  y=hsinθ . These trigonometric relationships are useful for adding vectors.

When a vector acts in more than one dimension, it is useful to break it down into its x and y components. For a two-dimensional vector, a **component** is a piece of a vector that points in either the x- or y-direction. Every 2-d vector can be expressed as a sum of its x and y components.

For example, given a vector like A in [None](None), we may want to find what two perpendicular vectors, Ax and Ay, add to produce it. In this example, Ax and Ay form a right triangle, meaning that the angle between them is 90 degrees. This is a common situation in physics and happens to be the least complicated situation trigonometrically.


        <caption>The vector </caption>
 Ax and Ay are defined to be the components of A along the *x*- and *y*-axes. The three vectors, A, Ax, and Ay, form a right triangle.

Ax + Ay = AIf the vector A is known, then its magnitude A (its length) and its angle θ (its direction) are known. To find Ax and Ay, its *x*- and *y*-components, we use the following relationships for a right triangle:

Ax=Acosθand

Ay=Asinθ,where Ax is the magnitude of *A* in the *x*-direction, Ay is the magnitude of *A* in the *y*-direction, and θ is the angle of the resultant with respect to the *x*-axis, as shown in [None](None).


        <caption>The magnitudes of the vector components </caption>
Suppose, for example, that A is the vector representing the total displacement of the person walking in a city, as illustrated in [None](None).


        <caption>We can use the relationships  </caption>
Then A = 10.3 blocks and  θ=29.1∘, so that 

Ax=Acosθ=(10.3 blocks)(cos29.1∘)=(10.3 blocks)(0.874)=9.0 blocks.This magnitude indicates that the walker has traveled 9 blocks to the east—in other words, a 9-block eastward displacement. Similarly, 

Ay=Asinθ=(10.3 blocks)(sin29.1∘)=(10.3 blocks)(0.846)=5.0 blocks,indicating that the walker has traveled 5 blocks to the north—a 5-block northward displacement.



### Analytical Method of Vector Addition and Subtraction

Calculating a resultant vector (or vector addition) is the reverse of breaking the resultant down into its components. If the perpendicular components  Ax  and  Ay  of a vector  A  are known, then we can find  A  analytically. How do we do this? Since, by definition, 

tanθ=y/x (or in this case tanθ=Ay/Ax),we solve for  θ  to find the direction of the resultant.

θ=tan−1(Ay/Ax)Note that tan−1(θ) gives an angle in the first quadrant if 
      Ay/Ax>0 and in the fourth quadrant if 
      Ay/Ax<0. If, in fact, both Ax and Ay are negative, or if Ax is negative and Ay positive, then θ, measured from the positive x direction, is 
      tan–1(θ)+180°.

Since this is a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem (x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = h<sup>2</sup>) for finding the hypotenuse applies. In this case, it becomes

A2=Ax2+Ay2.Solving for A gives

A=Ax2+Ay2.In summary, to find the magnitude  A  and direction  θ  of a vector from its perpendicular components  Ax  and  Ay, as illustrated in [None](None), we use the following relationships:

A=Ax2+Ay2θ=tan−1(Ay/Ax)
          <caption>The magnitude and direction of the resultant vector </caption>
Sometimes, the vectors added are not perfectly perpendicular to one another. An example of this is the case below, where the vectors  A  and  B  are added to produce the resultant  R,  as illustrated in [None](None).


          <caption>Vectors </caption>
If A and B represent two legs of a walk (two displacements), then R is the total displacement. The person taking the walk ends up at the tip of R . There are many ways to arrive at the same point. The person could have walked straight ahead first in the *x*-direction and then in the *y*-direction. Those paths are the *x*- and *y*-components of the resultant, Rx and Ry. If we know Rx and Ry, we can find R and θ using the equations R=Rx2+Ry2 and θ=tan–1(Ry/Rx) .

2. *x**x*Rx=Ax+Bxand find the *y* component of the resultant (as illustrated in [None](None)) by adding the *y* component of the vectors.

Now that we know the components of  R,  we can find its magnitude and direction.

### Using the Analytical Method of Vector Addition and Subtraction to Solve Problems

[None](None) uses the analytical method to add vectors.

## An Accelerating Subway Train
Add the vector A to the vector B shown in [None](None), using the steps above. The *x*-axis is along the east–west direction, and the *y*-axis is along the north–south directions. A person first walks 53.0 m in a direction 20.0° north of east, represented by vector A. The person then walks 34.0 m in a direction 63.0° north of east, represented by vector B. 


            <caption>You can use analytical models to add vectors.</caption>
## Strategy
The components of A and B along the *x*- and *y*-axes represent walking due east and due north to get to the same ending point. We will solve for these components and then add them in the x-direction and y-direction to find the resultant.

## Solution
First, we find the components of A and B along the *x*- and *y*-axes. From the problem, we know that A=53.0 m, θA=20.0∘, B = 34.0 m, and θB=63.0∘ . We find the *x*-components by using Ax=Acosθ, which gives

Ax=AcosθA=(53.0 m)(cos20.0∘)=(53.0 m)(0.940)=49.8 mand

Bx=BcosθB=(34.0 m)(cos63.0∘)=(34.0 m)(0.454)=15.4 m.Similarly, the *y*-components are found using Ay=AsinθA 

Ay=AsinθA=(53.0 m)(sin20.0∘)=(53.0 m)(0.342)=18.1 mand

By=BsinθB=(34.0 m)(sin63.0∘)=(34.0 m)(0.891)=30.3 m.The *x*- and *y*-components of the resultant are 

Rx=Ax+Bx=49.8 m+15.4 m=65.2 mand

Ry=Ay+By=18.1 m+30.3 m=48.4 m.Now we can find the magnitude of the resultant by using the Pythagorean theorem

R=Rx2+Ry2=(65.2)2+(48.4)2 mso that

R=6601 m=81.2 m .Finally, we find the direction of the resultant

θ=tan−1(Ry/Rx)=+tan−1(48.4/65.2).This is

θ=tan−1(0.742)=36.6∘.## Discussion
This example shows vector addition using the analytical method. Vector subtraction using the analytical method is very similar. It is just the addition of a negative vector. That is, A−B≡A+(−B) . The components of – B are the negatives of the components of B . Therefore, the *x*- and *y*-components of the resultant A−B=R  are 

Rx=Ax+-Bxand

Ry=Ay+-Byand the rest of the method outlined above is identical to that for addition.

## Atmospheric Science

          <caption>This picture shows Bert Foord during a television Weather Forecast from the Meteorological Office in 1963.  (BBC TV)</caption>
Atmospheric science is a **physical science**, meaning that it is a science based heavily on physics. Atmospheric science includes meteorology (the study of weather) and climatology (the study of climate). Climate is basically the average weather over a longer time scale. Weather changes quickly over time, whereas the climate changes more gradually.

The movement of air, water and heat is vitally important to climatology and meteorology. Since motion is such a major factor in weather and climate, this field uses vectors for much of its math. 

Vectors are used to represent currents in the ocean, wind velocity and forces acting on a parcel of air. You have probably seen a weather map using vectors to show the strength (magnitude) and direction of the wind. 

Vectors used in atmospheric science are often three-dimensional. We won’t cover three-dimensional motion in this text, but to go from two-dimensions to three-dimensions, you simply add a third vector component. Three-dimensional motion is represented as a combination of *x*-, *y*- and *z* components, where *z* is the altitude. 

Vector calculus combines vector math with calculus, and is often used to find the rates of change in temperature, pressure or wind speed over time or distance. This is useful information, since atmospheric motion is driven by changes in pressure or temperature. The greater the variation in pressure over a given distance, the stronger the wind to try to correct that imbalance. Cold air tends to be more dense and therefore has higher pressure than warm air. Higher pressure air rushes into a region of lower pressure and gets deflected by the spinning of the Earth, and friction slows the wind at Earth’s surface. 

Finding how wind changes over distance and multiplying vectors lets meteorologists, like the one shown in [None](None), figure out how much rotation (spin) there is in the atmosphere at any given time and location. This is an important tool for tornado prediction. Conditions with greater rotation are more likely to produce tornadoes.
