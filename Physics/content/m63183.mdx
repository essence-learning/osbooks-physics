### Half-Life and the Rate of Radioactive Decay

Unstable nuclei decay. However, some nuclides decay faster than others. For example, radium and polonium, discovered by Marie and Pierre Curie, decay faster than uranium. That means they have shorter lifetimes, producing a greater rate of decay. Here we will explore half-life and activity, the quantitative terms for lifetime and rate of decay.

Why do we use the term like *half-life* rather than *lifetime*? The answer can be found by examining [None](None), which shows how the number of radioactive nuclei in a sample decreases with time. The time in which half of the original number of nuclei decay is defined as the **half-life**,  t12 . After one half-life passes, half of the remaining nuclei will decay in the next half-life. Then, half of that amount in turn decays in the following half-life. Therefore, the number of radioactive nuclei decreases from *N* to *N* / 2 in one half-life, to *N* / 4 in the next, to *N* / 8 in the next, and so on. Nuclear decay is an example of a purely statistical process.

A more precise definition of half-life is that each nucleus has a 50 percent chance of surviving for a time equal to one half-life. If an individual nucleus survives through that time, it still has a 50 percent chance of surviving through another half-life. Even if it happens to survive hundreds of half-lives, it still has a 50 percent chance of surviving through one more. Therefore, the decay of a nucleus is like random coin flipping. The chance of heads is 50 percent, no matter what has happened before. 

The probability concept aligns with the traditional definition of half-life. Provided the number of nuclei is reasonably large, half of the original nuclei should decay during one half-life period.


<caption>Radioactive decay reduces the number of radioactive nuclei over time. In one half-life ( </caption>
The following equation gives the quantitative relationship between the original number of nuclei present at time zero  (NO)  and the number  (N)  at a later time *t*

N=NOe−λt,where *e* = 2.71828... is the base of the natural logarithm, and  λ  is the **decay constant** for the nuclide. The shorter the half-life, the larger is the value of  λ, and the faster the exponential  e−λt  decreases with time. The decay constant can be found with the equation

λ=ln(2)t1/2≈0.693t1/2.

### Activity, the Rate of Decay

What do we mean when we say a source is highly radioactive? Generally, it means the number of decays per unit time is very high. We define **activity** *R* to be the rate of decay expressed in decays per unit time. In equation form, this is

R=ΔNΔt,where  ΔN  is the number of decays that occur in time  Δt .

Activity can also be determined through the equation

R=λN,which shows that as the amount of radiative material (*N*) decreases, the rate of decay decreases as well.

The SI unit for activity is one decay per second and it is given the name **becquerel** (Bq) in honor of the discoverer of radioactivity. That is,

 1 Bq = 1 decay/second.


Activity *R* is often expressed in other units, such as decays per minute or decays per year. One of the most common units for activity is the curie (Ci), defined to be the activity of 1 g of <sup>226</sup>Ra, in honor of Marie Curie’s work with radium. The definition of the curie is

1 Ci = 3.70×1010 Bq,or  3.70×1010  decays per second.



### Radiometric Dating

**Radioactive dating** or radiometric dating is a clever use of naturally occurring radioactivity. Its most familiar application is **carbon-14 dating**. Carbon-14 is an isotope of carbon that is produced when solar neutrinos strike  14N  particles within the atmosphere. Radioactive carbon has the same chemistry as stable carbon, and so it mixes into the biosphere, where it is consumed and becomes part of every living organism. Carbon-14 has an abundance of 1.3 parts per trillion of normal carbon, so if you know the number of carbon nuclei in an object (perhaps determined by mass and Avogadro’s number), you can multiply that number by  1.3×10−12  to find the number of  14C  nuclei within the object. Over time, carbon-14 will naturally decay back to  14N  with a half-life of 5,730 years (note that this is an example of beta decay). When an organism dies, carbon exchange with the environment ceases, and  14C  is not replenished. By comparing the abundance of  14C  in an artifact, such as mummy wrappings, with the normal abundance in living tissue, it is possible to determine the artifact’s age (or time since death). Carbon-14 dating can be used for biological tissues as old as 50 or 60 thousand years, but is most accurate for younger samples, since the abundance of  14C  nuclei in them is greater.

One of the most famous cases of carbon-14 dating involves the Shroud of Turin, a long piece of fabric purported to be the burial shroud of Jesus (see [None](None)). This relic was first displayed in Turin in 1354 and was denounced as a fraud at that time by a French bishop. Its remarkable negative imprint of an apparently crucified body resembles the then-accepted image of Jesus. As a result, the relic has been remained controversial throughout the centuries. Carbon-14 dating was not performed on the shroud until 1988, when the process had been refined to the point where only a small amount of material needed to be destroyed. Samples were tested at three independent laboratories, each being given four pieces of cloth, with only one unidentified piece from the shroud, to avoid prejudice. All three laboratories found samples of the shroud contain 92 percent of the  14C  found in living tissues, allowing the shroud to be dated (see [None](None)).

## Carbon-11 Decay
Carbon-11 has a half-life of 20.334 min. (a) What is the decay constant for carbon-11?

If 1 kg of carbon-11 sample exists at the beginning of an hour, (b) how much material will remain at the end of the hour and (c) what will be the decay activity at that time?

## Strategy
Since  NO  refers to the amount of carbon-11 at the start, then after one half-life, the amount of carbon-11 remaining will be  NO/2. The decay constant is equivalent to the probability that a nucleus will decay each second. As a result, the half-life will need to be converted to seconds.

## Solution
(a)

N=NOe−λtSince half of the carbon-11 remains after one half-life,  N/NO=0.5 .

0.5=e−λtTake the natural logarithm of each side to isolate the decay constant.

ln(0.5)=−λtConvert the 20.334 min to seconds.

−0.693=(−λ)(20.334 min)(60s1 min)−0.693=(−λ)(1,220.04s)−0.6931,220.04s=−λλ=5.68×10−4s−1(b) The amount of material after one hour can be found by using the equation

N=NOe−λt,with *t* converted into seconds and *N* written as 1,000 g

N=(1,000 g)e−(0.000568)(60.60)N=129.4g(c) The decay activity after one hour can be found by using the equation

R=λNfor the mass value after one hour.

R=λN=(0.000568decayssecond)(129.4grams)=0.0735Bq## Discussion
(a) The decay constant shows that 0.0568 percent of the nuclei in a carbon-11 sample will decay each second. Another way of considering the decay constant is that a given carbon-11 nuclei has a 0.0568 percent probability of decaying each second. The decay of carbon-11 allows it to be used in positron emission topography (PET) scans; however, its 20.334 min half-life does pose challenges for its administration.

(b) One hour is nearly three full half-lives of the carbon-11 nucleus. As a result, one would expect the amount of sample remaining to be approximately one eighth of the original amount. The 129.4 g remaining is just a bit larger than one-eighth, which is sensible given a half-life of just over 20 min.

(c) Label analysis shows that the unit of Becquerel is sensible, as there are 0.0735 g of carbon-11 decaying each second. That is smaller amount than at the beginning of the hour, when  R=(0.000568decays)(1,000g)=0.568  g of carbon-11 were decaying each second.

## How Old is the Shroud of Turin?
Calculate the age of the Shroud of Turin given that the amount of  14C  found in it is 92 percent of that in living tissue.

## Strategy
Because 92 percent of the  14C  remains,  N/NO=0.92 . Therefore, the equation  N=NOe−λt  can be used to find  λt . We also know that the half-life of  14C  is 5,730 years, and so once  λt  is known, we can find  λ  and then find *t *as requested. Here, we assume that the decrease in  14C  is solely due to nuclear decay.

## Solution
Solving the equation  N=NOe−λt  for  N/NO  gives

NNO=e−λt.Thus,

0.92=e−λt.Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation yields

ln0.92=−λtso that

−0.0834=−λt.Rearranging to isolate *t* gives

t=0.0834λ.Now, the equation  λ=0.693t1/2  can be used to find  λ  for  14C . Solving for  λ  and substituting the known half-life gives

λ=0.693t1/2=0.6935,730years=1.21×10−4y−1.We enter that value into the previous equation to find *t*.



t=0.08341.21×10−4=690years.


## Discussion
This dates the material in the shroud to 1988–690 = 1300. Our calculation is only accurate to two digits, so that the year is rounded to 1300. The values obtained at the three independent laboratories gave a weighted average date of 1320 ± 60. That uncertainty is typical of carbon-14 dating and is due to the small amount of 14 C in living tissues, the amount of material available, and experimental uncertainties (reduced by having three independent measurements). That said, is it notable that the carbon-14 date is consistent with the first record of the shroud’s existence and certainly inconsistent with the period in which Jesus lived.

There are other noncarbon forms of radioactive dating. Rocks, for example, can sometimes be dated based on the decay of  238U. The decay series for  238U  ends with  206Pb, so the ratio of those nuclides in a rock can be used an indication of how long it has been since the rock solidified. Knowledge of the  238U  half-life has shown, for example, that the oldest rocks on Earth solidified about  3.5 × 109
 years ago.

### Critical Thinking

Provide an example of something that decreases in a manner similar to radioactive decay.

1. The potential energy of an object falling under the influence of gravity
2. The kinetic energy of a ball that is dropped from a building to the ground
3. Theh charge transfer from an ebonite rod to fur
4. The heat transfer from a hot to a cold object

A sample of radioactive material has a decay constant of 0.05 s<sup>1</sup>. Why is it wrong to presume that the sample will take just 20 seconds to fully decay?

1. The decay constant varies with the mass of the sample.
2. The decay constant results vary with the amount of the sample.
3. The decay constant represents a percentage of the sample that cannot decay.
4. The decay constant represents only the fraction of a sample that decays in a unit of time, not the decay of the entire sample.
