Atomists of the Greek and Indian empires, like Democritus of fifth century B.C., openly wondered about the most finite components of our universe. Though dormant for centuries, curiosity about the atomic nature of matter was reinvigorated by Rutherford’s gold foil experiment and the discovery of the nucleus. By the early 1930s, scientists believed they had fully determined the tiniest constituents of matter—in the form of the proton, neutron, and electron.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167063730479">This would be only partially true. At present, scientists know that there are hundreds of particles not unlike our electron and nucleons, all making up what some have termed the <emphasis effect="italics">particle zoo</emphasis>. While we are confident that the electron remains fundamental, it is surrounded by a plethora of similar sounding terms, like leptons, hadrons, baryons, and mesons. Even though not every particle is considered fundamental, they all play a vital role in understanding the intricate structure of our universe.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167067269151">A fundamental particle is defined as a particle with no substructure and no finite size. According to the <term>Standard Model</term>, there are three types of fundamental particles: leptons, quarks, and carrier particles. As you may recall, carrier particles are responsible for transmitting fundamental forces between their interacting masses. <term>Leptons</term> are a group of six particles not bound by the strong nuclear force, of which the electron is one. As for quarks, they are the fundamental building blocks of a group of particles called <term>hadrons</term>, a group that includes both the proton and the neutron.</para>

</note>
<para id="fs-id1167067292346">Now for a brief history of <term>quarks</term>. Quarks were first proposed independently by American physicists <term class="no-emphasis">Murray Gell-Mann</term> and <term class="no-emphasis">George Zweig</term> in 1963. Originally, three quark types—or <term>flavors</term>—were proposed with the names <term>up</term> (<emphasis effect="italics">u</emphasis>), <term>down</term> (<emphasis effect="italics">d</emphasis>), and <term>strange</term> (<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167063707423">At first, physicists expected that, with sufficient energy, we should be able to free quarks and observe them directly. However, this has not proved possible, as the current understanding is that the force holding quarks together is incredibly great and, much like a spring, increases in magnitude as the quarks are separated. As a result, when large energies are put into collisions, other particles are created—but no quarks emerge. With that in mind, there is compelling evidence for the existence of quarks. By 1967, experiments at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory scattering 20-GeV electrons from protons produced results like Rutherford had obtained for the nucleus nearly 60 years earlier. The SLAC scattering experiments showed unambiguously that there were three point-like (meaning they had sizes considerably smaller than the probe’s wavelength) charges inside the proton as seen in <link target-id="Figure_23_02_SLAC"/>. This evidence made all but the most skeptical admit that there was validity to the quark substructure of hadrons.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167067227413">Students should reflect on the idea that quarks have not been observed directly. Help them recognize that the lack of direct evidence does not mean that the evidence for quarks is weak. As will be seen in the discussion on fractional charge and color, the reason an individual quark has not been exposed may be more complex than expected.</para>

<media id="fs-id1167067275298" alt="The image shows a large blue sphere representing a proton with three small spheres within it. The three small spheres are labeled ‘u’, ‘u’, and ‘d’, and are colored blue, green, and red, respectively. These three smaller spheres represent up and down quarks. From the left to the right of the image are arrows representing the trajectory of electrons. Some of the electrons pass through the proton, while others are shown striking the quarks and scattering away."><image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/CNX_HSPhysics_23_02_SLAC.jpg"/></media>
<caption>Scattering of high-energy electrons from protons at facilities like SLAC produces evidence of three point-like charges consistent with proposed quark properties. This experiment is analogous to Rutherford’s discovery of the small size of the nucleus by scattering α particles. High-energy electrons are used so that the probe wavelength is small enough to see details smaller than the proton.</caption>

<para id="fs-id1167067191207">The inclusion of the strange quark with Zweig and Gell-Mann’s model concerned physicists. While the up and down quarks demonstrated fairly clear symmetry and were present in common fundamental particles like protons and neutrons, the strange quark did not have a counterpart of its own. This thought, coupled with the four known leptons at the time, caused scientists to predict that a fourth quark, yet to be found, also existed. </para>
<para id="fs-id1167067066829">In 1974, two groups of physicists independently discovered a particle with this new quark, labeled <term>charmed</term>. This completed the second <emphasis effect="italics">exotic</emphasis> quark pair, strange (s) and charmed (c). A final pair of quarks was proposed when a third pair of leptons was discovered in 1975. The existence of the <term>bottom</term> (b) quark and the <term>top</term> (t) quark was verified through experimentation in 1976 and 1995, respectively. While it may seem odd that so much time would elapse between the original quark discovery in 1967 and the verification of the top quark in 1995, keep in mind that each quark discovered had a progressively larger mass. As a result, each new quark has required more energy to discover.</para>
<note id="fs-id1167061391912" class="tips-for-success">

<para id="fs-id1167067200801">Note that a very important tenet of science occurred throughout the period of quark discovery. The charmed, bottom, and top quarks were all speculated on, and then were discovered some time later. Each of their discoveries helped to verify and strengthen the quark model. This process of speculation and verification continues to take place today and is part of what drives physicists to search for evidence of the graviton and Grand Unified Theory.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167063473947">One of the most confounding traits of quarks is their electric charge. Long assumed to be discrete, and specifically a multiple of the elementary charge of the electron, the electric charge of an individual quark is fractional and thus seems to violate a presumed tenet of particle physics. The fractional charge of quarks, which are  <m:math>

</table><para id="fs-id1167067272765">While the term <emphasis effect="italics">flavor</emphasis> is used to differentiate between types of quarks, the concept of <term>color</term> is more analogous to the electric charge in that it is primarily responsible for the force interactions between quarks. Note—Take a moment to think about the electrostatic force. It is the electric charge that causes attraction and repulsion. It is the same case here but with a <emphasis effect="italics">color</emphasis> charge. The three colors available to a quark are red, green, and blue, with antiquarks having colors of anti-red (or cyan), anti-green (or magenta), and anti-blue (or yellow).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167066962535">Why use colors when discussing quarks? After all, the quarks are not actually colored with visible light. The reason colors are used is because the properties of a quark are analogous to the three primary and secondary colors mentioned above. Just as different colors of light can be combined to create white, different <emphasis effect="italics">colors</emphasis> of quark may be combined to construct a particle like a proton or neutron. In fact, for each hadron, the quarks must combine such that their color sums to white! Recall that two up quarks and one down quark construct a proton, as seen in <link target-id="Figure_23_02_SLAC"/>. The sum of the three quarks’ colors—red, green, and blue—yields the color white. This theory of color interaction within particles is called <term>quantum chromodynamics</term>, or QCD. As part of QCD, the strong nuclear force can be explained using color. In fact, some scientists refer to the color force, not the strong force, as one of the four fundamental forces. <link target-id="Figure_23_02_Color"/> is a Feynman diagram showing the interaction between two quarks by using the transmission of a colored <term>gluon</term>. Note that the gluon is also considered the charge carrier for the strong nuclear force.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167066862730">What internal structure makes a proton so different from an electron? The proton, like all hadrons, is made up of quarks. A few examples of hadron quark composition can be seen in <link target-id="Figure_23_02_Hadron"/>. As shown, each hadron is constructed of multiple quarks. As mentioned previously, the fractional quark charge in all four hadrons sums to the particle’s integral value. Also, notice that the color composition for each of the four particles adds to white. Each of the particles shown is constructed of up, down, and their antiquarks. This is not surprising, as the quarks strange, charmed, top, and bottom are found in only our most exotic particles.</para>

The third image is of a positive pion, which is composed of two quarks (up and anti-down). The colors of its quarks are red and anti-red. The final picture is of a negative pion, which is composed of two quarks (anti-up and down). The colors of its quarks are green and anti-green.

<title>Matter and Antimatter</title>
<para id="fs-id1167063519769"><term>Antimatter</term> was first discovered in the form of the <term>positron</term>, the positively charged electron. In 1932, American physicist Carl Anderson discovered the positron in cosmic ray studies. Through a cloud chamber modified to curve the trajectories of cosmic rays, Anderson noticed that the curves of some particles followed that of a negative charge, while others curved like a positive charge. However, the positive curve showed not the mass of a proton but the mass of an electron. This outcome is shown in <link target-id="Figure_23_02_Positron"/> and suggests the existence of a positively charged version of the electron, created by the destruction of solar photons.</para>

Note that the color-coding system in this chart is separate from the red, green, and blue color labeling system of quarks. The first three columns represent the three <emphasis effect="italics">families</emphasis> of matter. The first column, considered Family 1, represents particles that make up normal matter, constructing the protons, neutrons, and electrons that make up the common world. Family 2, represented from the charm quark to the muon neutrino, is comprised of particles that are more massive. The leptons in this group are less stable and more likely to decay. Family 3, represented by the third column, are more massive still and decay more quickly. The order of these families also conveniently represents the order in which these particles were discovered.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167067117773">One interesting feature of the Standard Model shown in <link target-id="Figure_23_02_Revised"/> is that, while the gluon and photon have no mass, the Z and W bosons are very massive. What supplies these quickly moving particles with mass and not the gluons and photons? Furthermore, what causes some quarks to have more mass than others?</para>
<para id="fs-id1167063652341">In the 1960s, British physicist <term class="no-emphasis">Peter Higgs</term> and others speculated that the W and Z bosons were actually just as massless as the gluon and photon. However, as the W and Z bosons traveled from one particle to another, they were slowed down by the presence of a <term>Higgs field</term>, much like a fish swimming through water. The thinking was that the existence of the Higgs field would slow down the bosons, causing them to decrease in energy and thereby transfer this energy to mass. Under this theory, all particles pass through the Higgs field, which exists throughout the universe. The gluon and photon travel through this field as well but are able to do so unaffected.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167063837661">The presence of a force from the Higgs field suggests the existence of its own carrier particle, the Higgs boson. This theorized boson interacts with all particles but gluons and photons, transferring force from the Higgs field. Particles with large mass (like the top quark) are more likely to receive force from the Higgs boson.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167067090093">While it is difficult to examine a field, it is somewhat simpler to find evidence of its carrier. On July 4, 2012, two groups of scientists at the LHC independently confirmed the existence of a Higgs-like particle. By examining trillions of proton–proton collisions at energies of 7 to 8 TeV, LHC scientists were able to determine the constituent particles that created the protons. In this data, scientists found a particle with similar mass, spin, parity, and interactions with other particles that matched the Higgs boson predicted decades prior. On March 13, 2013, the existence of the Higgs boson was tentatively confirmed by CERN. Peter Higgs and Francois Englert received the Nobel Prize in 2013 for the “theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin and mass of subatomic particles.”</para>

<para id="fs-id1167061628540">If you have an innate desire to unravel life’s great mysteries and further understand the nature of the physical world, a career in particle physics may be for you!</para>
<para id="fs-id1167067204644">Particle physicists have played a critical role in much of society’s technological progress. From lasers to computers, televisions to space missions, splitting the atom to understanding the DNA molecule to MRIs and PET scans, much of our modern society is based on the work done by particle physicists.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167066946346">While many particle physicists focus on specialized tasks in the fields of astronomy and medicine, the main goal of particle physics is to further scientists’ understanding of the Standard Model. This may mean work in government, industry, or academics. Within the government, jobs in particle physics can be found within the National Institute for Standards and Technology, Department of Energy, NASA, and Department of Defense. Both the electronics and computer industries rely on the expertise of particle physicists. College teaching and research positions can also be potential career opportunities for particle physicists, though they often require some postgraduate work as a prerequisite. In addition, many particle physicists are employed to work on high-energy colliders. Domestic collider labs include the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago, and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory operated by Stanford University. For those who like to travel, work at international collider labs can be found at the CERN facility in Switzerland in addition to institutes like the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics in Russia, DESY in Germany, and KEK in Japan.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167067012413">Shirley Jackson became the first African American woman to earn a Ph.D. from MIT back in 1973, and she went on to lead a highly successful career in the field of particle physics. Like Dr. Jackson, successful students of particle physics grow up with a strong curiosity in the world around them and a drive to continually learn more. If you are interested in exploring a career in particle physics, work to achieve good grades and SAT scores, and find time to read popular books on physics topics that interest you. While some math may be challenging, recognize that this is only a tool of physics and should not be considered prohibitive to the field. High-level work in particle physics often requires a Ph.D.; however, it is possible to find work with a master’s degree. Additionally, jobs in industry and teaching can be achieved with solely an undergraduate degree.</para>

<item>There are three types of fundamental particles—leptons, quarks, and carrier particles.</item>
<item>Quarks come in six flavors and three colors and occur only in combinations that produce white.</item>
<item>Hadrons are thought to be composed of quarks, with baryons having three quarks and mesons having a quark and an antiquark.</item>
<item>Known particles can be divided into three major groups—leptons, hadrons, and carrier particles (gauge bosons).</item>
<item>All particles of matter have an antimatter counterpart that has the opposite charge and certain other quantum numbers. These matterantimatter pairs are otherwise very similar but will annihilate when brought together.</item>
<item>The strong force is carried by eight proposed particles called gluons, which are intimately connected to a quantum number called color—their governing theory is thus called quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Taken together, QCD and the electroweak theory are widely accepted as the Standard Model of particle physics.</item>

A vertical time axis and horizontal x-axis or distance is in the bottom left hand corner of the schematic relating to these equations. Inside of the axis are five spheres, three in a diagonal pattern are red with two green ones on either side of the filled diagonal. The two equations are showing the process by which the R, red d sphere, and G, green s sphere, react with a creation of the R G, red g sphere, by the R, red d sphere, to create G, green d sphere. The other initial G, green s sphere, reacts with the newly created R G sphere to create R, red s sphere.">
