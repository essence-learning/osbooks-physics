<title>Graphing Position as a Function of Time</title>
<para id="fs-id1167067216326">A <term class="no-emphasis">graph</term>, like a picture, is worth a thousand words. Graphs not only contain numerical information, they also reveal relationships between physical quantities. In this section, we will investigate <term class="no-emphasis">kinematics</term> by analyzing graphs of <term class="no-emphasis">position</term> over <term class="no-emphasis">time</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167066879725">Graphs in this text have perpendicular axes, one horizontal and the other vertical. When two physical quantities are plotted against each other, the horizontal axis is usually considered the <term>independent variable</term>, and the vertical axis is the <term>dependent variable</term>. In algebra, you would have referred to the horizontal axis as the <emphasis effect="italics">x</emphasis>-axis and the vertical axis as the <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis>-axis. As in <link target-id="Figure_02_03_graph"/>, a straight-line graph has the general form  <m:math>

<para id="fs-id1167066823716">Here <emphasis effect="italics">m</emphasis> is the slope, defined as the rise divided by the run (as seen in the figure) of the straight line. The letter <emphasis effect="italics">b</emphasis> is the <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis>-intercept which is the point at which the line crosses the vertical, <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis>-axis.

<para id="fs-id1167067052799">In physics, time is usually the independent variable. Other quantities, such as displacement, are said to depend upon it. A graph of position versus time, therefore, would have position on the vertical axis (dependent variable) and time on the horizontal axis (independent variable). In this case, to what would the slope and <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis>-intercept refer? Let’s look back at our original example when studying distance and displacement.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167067259390">The graph of position versus time in <link target-id="Figure_02_03_jet"/> is a curve rather than a straight line. The slope of the curve becomes steeper as time progresses, showing that the velocity is increasing over time. The slope at any point on a position-versus-time graph is the instantaneous velocity at that point. It is found by drawing a straight line <term>tangent</term> to the curve at the point of interest and taking the slope of this straight line. Tangent lines are shown for two points in <link target-id="Figure_02_03_jet"/>. The average velocity is the net displacement divided by the time traveled.</para>

    <para id="fs-id1167066775102">A curved line is a more complicated example. Define tangent as a line that touches a curve at only one point. Show that as a straight line changes its angle next to a curve, it actually hits the curve multiple times at the base, but only one line will never touch at all. This line forms a right angle to the radius of curvature, but at this level, they can just kind of eyeball it. The slope of this line gives the instantaneous velocity. The most useful part of this line is that students can tell when the velocity is increasing, decreasing, positive, negative, and zero.</para>
