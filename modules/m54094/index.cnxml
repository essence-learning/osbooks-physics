<caption>A graph of position versus time for the drive to and from school is shown.</caption></figure><para id="fs-id1167066055063">We assumed for our original calculation that your parent drove with a constant velocity to and from school. We now know that the car could not have gone from rest to a constant velocity without speeding up. So the actual graph would be curved on either end, but let’s make the same approximation as we did then, anyway.</para>

<note id="fs-id1167064541094" class="tips-for-success">

<para id="fs-id1167065878215">It is common in physics, especially at the early learning stages, for certain things to be <emphasis effect="italics">neglected</emphasis>, as we see here. This is because it makes the concept clearer or the calculation easier. Practicing physicists use these kinds of short-cuts, as well. It works out because usually the thing being <emphasis effect="italics">neglected</emphasis> is small enough that it does not significantly affect the answer. In the earlier example, the amount of time it takes the car to speed up and reach its cruising velocity is very small compared to the total time traveled.</para>
</note>

<para id="fs-id1167064746552">Looking at this graph, and given what we learned, we can see that there are two distinct periods to the car’s motion—the way to school and the way back. The average velocity for the drive to school is 0.5 km/minute. We can see that the average velocity for the drive back is –0.5 km/minute. If we plot the data showing velocity versus time, we get another graph (<link target-id="Figure_02_04_velocity"/>):</para>

<caption>Graph of velocity versus time for the drive to and from school.</caption></figure><para id="fs-id1167065852951">We can learn a few things. First, we can derive a <emphasis>v</emphasis> versus <emphasis effect="italics">t</emphasis> graph from a <emphasis>d</emphasis> versus <emphasis effect="italics">t</emphasis> graph. Second, if we have a straight-line position–time graph that is positively or negatively sloped, it will yield a horizontal velocity graph. There are a few other interesting things to note. Just as we could use a position vs. time graph to determine velocity, we can use a velocity vs. time graph to determine position. We know that <emphasis>v</emphasis> = <emphasis>d</emphasis>/<emphasis effect="italics">t</emphasis>. If we use a little algebra to re-arrange the equation, we see that <emphasis>d</emphasis> = <emphasis>v</emphasis>  <m:math><m:mo>×</m:mo></m:math>  <emphasis effect="italics">t</emphasis>. In <link target-id="Figure_02_04_velocity"/>, we have velocity on the <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis>-axis and time along the <emphasis effect="italics">x</emphasis>-axis. Let’s take just the first half of the motion. We get 0.5 km/minute  <m:math><m:mo>×</m:mo></m:math>  10 minutes. The units for <emphasis effect="italics">minutes</emphasis> cancel each other, and we get 5 km, which is the displacement for the trip to school. If we calculate the same for the return trip, we get –5 km. If we add them together, we see that the net displacement for the whole trip is 0 km, which it should be because we started and ended at the same place.</para><note id="fs-id1167065895883" class="tips-for-success">

<para id="fs-id1167065852654">You can treat units just like you treat numbers, so a km/km=1 (or, we say, it cancels out). This is good because it can tell us whether or not we have calculated everything with the correct units. For instance, if we end up with m × s for velocity instead of m/s, we know that something has gone wrong, and we need to check our math. This process is called dimensional analysis, and it is one of the best ways to check if your math makes sense in physics.</para>
</note>

<para id="fs-id1167066160434">The area under a velocity curve represents the displacement. The velocity curve also tells us whether the car is speeding up. In our earlier example, we stated that the velocity was constant. So, the car is not speeding up. Graphically, you can see that the slope of these two lines is 0. This slope tells us that the car is not speeding up, or accelerating. We will do more with this information in a later chapter. For now, just remember that the area under the graph and the slope are the two important parts of the graph. Just like we could define a linear equation for the motion in a position vs. time graph, we can also define one for a velocity vs. time graph. As we said, the slope equals the acceleration, <emphasis>a</emphasis>. And in this graph, the <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis>-intercept is <emphasis>v</emphasis><sub>0</sub>. Thus,  <m:math>

<para id="fs-id1167065980209">This is a much more complicated process than the first problem. If we were to use these estimates to come up with the average velocity over just the first 30 s we would get about 191 m/s. By approximating that curve with a line, we get an average velocity of 202.5 m/s. Depending on our purposes and how precise an answer we need, sometimes calling a curve a straight line is a worthwhile approximation.</para>

If you drew a regular curve inside of the curve at the point you are interested in, you could draw a radius of that curve. The tangent line would be the line perpendicular to that radius.</para>
