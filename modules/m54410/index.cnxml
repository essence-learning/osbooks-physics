<title>Electric Charge</title>
<para id="fs-id1167067050748">You may know someone who has an <emphasis effect="italics">electric</emphasis> personality, which usually means that other people are attracted to this person. This saying is based on electric charge, which is a property of matter that causes objects to attract or repel each other. Electric charge comes in two varieties, which we call <emphasis effect="italics">positive</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">negative.</emphasis> Like charges repel each other, and unlike charges attract each other. Thus, two <term class="no-emphasis">positive charges</term> repel each other, as do two <term class="no-emphasis">negative charges</term>. A positive charge and a negative charge attract each other.</para><para id="fs-id1167067149892">How do we know there are two types of electric charge? When various materials are rubbed together in controlled ways, certain combinations of materials always result in a net charge of one type on one material and a net charge of the opposite type on the other material. By convention, we call one type of charge positive and the other type negative. For example, when glass is rubbed with silk, the glass becomes positively charged and the silk negatively charged. Because the glass and silk have opposite charges, they attract one another like clothes that have rubbed together in a dryer. Two <term class="no-emphasis">glass rods</term> rubbed with silk in this manner will repel one another, because each rod has positive charge on it. Similarly, two silk cloths rubbed in this manner will repel each other, because both cloths have negative charge. <link target-id="Figure_18_01_Posnegcharg"/> shows how these simple materials can be used to explore the nature of the force between charges.</para><figure id="Figure_18_01_Posnegcharg">

Part b: It shows two glass rods near each other, each with a series of plus signs. One rod is held from one end by a hand, and the other rod is suspended from its middle by a string.

Amuse the students by pushing the balloon first in one direction and then quickly moving the glass rod or comb to the opposite side of the balloon to make it decelerate and then move in the opposite direction.

<para id="fs-id1167063922854">It took scientists a long time to discover what lay behind these two types of charges. The word <emphasis effect="italics">electric</emphasis> itself comes from the Greek word <emphasis effect="italics">elektron</emphasis> for amber, because the ancient Greeks noticed that amber, when rubbed by fur, attracts dry straw. Almost 2,000 years later, the English physicist William Gilbert proposed a model that explained the effect of electric charge as being due to a mysterious electrical fluid that would pass from one object to another. This model was debated for several hundred years, but it was finally put to rest in 1897 by the work of the English physicist J. J. <term class="no-emphasis">Thomson</term> and French physicist Jean Perrin. Along with many others, Thomson and Perrin were studying the mysterious <emphasis effect="italics">cathode rays</emphasis> that were known at the time to consist of particles smaller than the smallest atom. Perrin showed that cathode rays actually carried negative electrical charge. Later, Thomson’s work led him to declare, “I can see no escape from the conclusion that [cathode rays] are charges of negative electricity carried by particles of matter.”</para>
<para id="fs-id1167067317587">It took several years of further experiments to confirm Thomson’s interpretation of the experiments, but science had in fact discovered the particle that carries the fundamental unit of negative electrical charge. We now know this particle as the <term>electron</term>.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167063730324">Atoms, however, were known to be electrically neutral, which means that they carry the same amount of positive and negative charge, so their net charge is zero. Because electrons are negative, some other part of the atom must contain positive charge. Thomson put forth what is called the <emphasis effect="italics">plum pudding model</emphasis>, in which he described atoms as being made of thousands of electrons swimming around in a nebulous mass of positive charge, as shown by the left-side image of <link target-id="Figure_18_01_pp"/>. His student, Ernest <term class="no-emphasis">Rutherford</term>, originally believed that this model was correct and used it (along with other models) to try to understand the results of his experiments bombarding gold foils with <emphasis effect="italics">alpha</emphasis> particles (i.e., helium atoms stripped of their electrons). The results, however, did not confirm Thomson’s model but rather destroyed it! Rutherford found that most of the space occupied by the gold atoms was actually empty and that almost all of the matter of each atom was concentrated into a tiny, extremely dense nucleus, as shown by the right-side image of <link target-id="Figure_18_01_pp"/>. The atomic nucleus was later found to contain particles called <term>protons</term>, each of which carries a unit of positive electric charge.<footnote id="fs-id1167067238739">Protons were later found to contain sub particles called <emphasis effect="italics">quarks</emphasis>, which have fractional electric charge. But that is another story that we leave for subsequent physics courses.</footnote></para>

A number of small red spheres are on the surface of the blue sphere and within the cut-away part of the blue sphere. Also, a number of faded red spheres lie within the blue sphere. The drawing on the right shows four ellipses evenly spaced around a common center, with a small blue sphere in each ellipse. Near the top is the word “Electrons,” with two lines connecting that word to two of the blue spheres. The common center contains a clump of four small red spheres and five small gray spheres. Near the top is another word, “Nucleus,” with a line connecting that word to the clump of spheres at the center.">

<caption>The left drawing shows Thompson’s plum-pudding model, in which the electrons swim around in a nebulous mass of positive charge. The right drawing shows Rutherford’s model, in which the electrons orbit around a tiny, massive nucleus. Note that the size of the nucleus is vastly exaggerated in this drawing. Were it drawn to scale with respect to the size of the electron orbits, the nucleus would not be visible to the naked eye in this drawing. Also, as far as science can currently detect, electrons are point particles, which means that they have no size at all!</caption>

<title>Measuring the Fundamental Electric Charge</title>
<para id="fs-id1167063496653">The American physicist Robert <term class="no-emphasis">Millikan</term> (1868–1953) and his student Harvey <term class="no-emphasis">Fletcher</term> (1884–1981) were the first to make a relatively accurate measurement of the fundamental unit of charge on the electron. They designed what is now a classic experiment performed by students. The Millikan <term class="no-emphasis">oil-drop</term> experiment is shown in <link target-id="Figure_18_01_Oildrop"/>. The experiment involves some concepts that will be introduced later, but the basic idea is that a fine oil mist is sprayed between two plates that can be charged with a known amount of opposite charge. Some oil drops accumulate some excess negative charge when being sprayed and are attracted to the positive charge of the upper plate and repelled by the negative charge on the lower plate. By tuning the charge on these plates until the weight of the oil drop is balanced by the electric forces, the net charge on the oil drop can be determined quite precisely.</para>

<figure id="Figure_18_01_Oildrop">
<media id="fs-id1167067324564" alt="This figure is a two-part drawing. One part consists of two circular plates held parallel to each other, with a beam of light shining between them. Each plate has a wire attached to it. The upper plate, with a tiny hole at its center, is marked with a plus sign, and the lower plate is marked with a minus sign. A small spray bottle, labeled “Atomizer,” is held by a hand near and just above the upper plate. The hand squeezes a bulb on the Atomizer, and a spray labeled “Oil” emerges just above the upper plate. The beam of light emerges from a source labeled “Bright light.” The drawing includes a telescope-like device aimed for viewing between the circular plates. The second part of the drawing, located slightly below the first part, shows an edge-on view of the two plates. A downward pointing arrow connects the plates in the first part of the drawing to those in the second part. In the latter drawing, four vertical blue arrows point from the upper to the lower plate, and the arrow on the extreme right is labeled as E. A gray sphere between the two plates is labeled “Oil droplet.” A short red arrow, labeled F subscript E, points from the sphere to the upper plate, and another short red arrow, labeled w, points from the sphere to the lower plate.">

</m:math>  Although this difference may seem quite small, it is actually five times greater than the possible error Millikan reported for his results!</para><para id="fs-id1167067053620">Because the charge on the electron is a fundamental constant of nature, determining its precise value is very important for all of science. This created pressure on Millikan and others after him that reveals some equally important aspects of human nature.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167067140414">First, Millikan took sole credit for the experiment and was awarded the 1923 Nobel Prize in physics for this work, although his student Harvey Fletcher apparently contributed in significant ways to the work. Just before his death in 1981, Fletcher divulged that Millikan coerced him to give Millikan sole credit for the work, in exchange for which Millikan promoted Fletcher’s career at Bell Labs.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167063734521">Another great scientist, Richard Feynman, points out that many scientists who measured the fundamental charge after Millikan were reluctant to report values that differed much from Millikan’s value. History shows that later measurements slowly crept up from Millikan’s value until settling on the modern value. Why did they not immediately find the error and correct the value, asks Feynman. Apparently, having found a value higher than the much-respected value found by Millikan, scientists would look for possible mistakes that might lower their value to make it agree better with Millikan’s value. This reveals the important psychological weight carried by preconceived notions and shows how hard it is to refute them. Scientists, however devoted to logic and data they may be, are apparently just as vulnerable to this aspect of human nature as everyone else. The lesson here is that, although it is good to be skeptical of new results, you should not discount them just because they do not agree with conventional wisdom. If your reasoning is sound and your data are reliable, the conclusion demanded by the data must be seriously considered, even if that conclusion disagrees with the commonly accepted <emphasis effect="italics">truth.</emphasis></para>

<para id="fs-id1167066805452">Because the fundamental positive and negative units of charge are carried on protons and electrons, we would expect that the total charge cannot change in any system that we define. In other words, although we might be able to move charge around, we cannot create or destroy it. This should be true provided that we do not create or destroy protons or electrons in our system. In the twentieth century, however, scientists learned how to create and destroy electrons and protons, but they found that charge is still conserved.

</note>
<para id="fs-id1167067028695">Most objects we deal with are electrically neutral, which means that they have the same amount of positive and negative charge. However, transferring negative charge from one object to another is fairly easy to do. When negative charge is transferred from one object to another, an excess of positive charge is left behind. How do we know that the negative charge is the mobile charge? The positive charge is carried by the proton, which is stuck firmly in the nucleus of atoms, and the atoms are stuck in place in solid materials. Electrons, which carry the negative charge, are much easier to remove from their atoms or molecules and can therefore be transferred more easily.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167067180651">Electric charge can be transferred in several manners. One of the simplest ways to transfer charge is charging by contact, in which the surfaces of two objects made of different materials are placed in close contact. If one of the materials holds electrons more tightly than the other, then it takes some electrons with it when the materials are separated. Rubbing two surfaces together increases the transfer of electrons, because it creates a closer contact between the materials. It also serves to present <emphasis effect="italics">fresh</emphasis> material with a full supply of electrons to the other material. Thus, when you walk across a carpet on a dry day, your shoes rub against the carpet, and some electrons are removed from the carpet by your shoes. The result is that you have an excess of negative charge on your shoes. When you then touch a doorknob, some of your excess of electrons transfer to the neutral doorknob, creating a small spark.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167067006421">Touching the doorknob with your hand demonstrates a second way to transfer electric charge, which is charging by <term>conduction</term>. This transfer happens because like charges repel, and so the excess electrons that you picked up from the carpet want to be as far away from each other as possible. Some of them move to the doorknob, where they will distribute themselves over the outer surface of the metal. Another example of charging by conduction is shown in the top row of <link target-id="Figure_18_01_Transferel"/>. A metal sphere with 100 excess electrons touches a metal sphere with 50 excess electrons, so 25 electrons from the first sphere transfer to the second sphere. Each sphere finishes with 75 excess electrons.</para><para id="fs-id1167067199731">The same reasoning applies to the transfer of positive charge. However, because positive charge essentially cannot move in solids, it is transferred by moving negative charge in the opposite direction. For example, consider the bottom row of <link target-id="Figure_18_01_Transferel"/>. The first metal sphere has 100 excess protons and touches a metal sphere with 50 excess protons, so the second sphere transfers 25 electrons to the first sphere. These 25 extra electrons will electrically cancel 25 protons so that the first metal sphere is left with 75 excess protons. This is shown in the bottom row of <link target-id="Figure_18_01_Transferel"/>. The second metal sphere lost 25 electrons so it has 25 more excess protons, for a total of 75 excess protons. The end result is the same if we consider that the first ball transferred a net positive charge equal to that of 25 protons to the first ball.</para><figure id="Figure_18_01_Transferel"><media id="fs-id1167067031507" alt="This figure consists of two rows, and each row is divided into three columns labeled as “Before contact”, “At contact”, and “After contact”.

<para id="fs-id1167067099970">In this discussion, you may wonder how the excess electrons originally got from your shoes to your hand to create the spark when you touched the doorknob. The answer is that <emphasis effect="italics">no</emphasis> electrons actually traveled from your shoes to your hands. Instead, because like charges repel each other, the excess electrons on your shoe simply pushed away some of the electrons in your feet. The electrons thus dislodged from your feet moved up into your leg and in turn pushed away some electrons in your leg. This process continued through your whole body until a distribution of excess electrons covered the extremities of your body. Thus your head, your hands, the tip of your nose, and so forth all received their doses of excess electrons that had been pushed out of their normal positions. All this was the result of electrons being pushed out of your feet by the excess electrons on your shoes.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167067104324">This type of charge separation is called <term>polarization</term>. As soon as the excess electrons leave your shoes (by rubbing off onto the floor or being carried away in humid air), the distribution of electrons in your body returns to normal. Every part of your body is again electrically neutral (i.e., zero excess charge).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167067230896">The phenomenon of polarization is seen in <link document="m54417" target-id="Figure_18_00_Plasticsli"/>. The child has accumulated excess positive charge by sliding on the slide. This excess charge repels itself and so becomes distributed over the extremities of the child’s body, notably in his hair. As a result, the hair stands on end, because the excess negative charge on each strand repels the excess positive charge on neighboring strands.</para><para id="fs-id1167066952679">Polarization can be used to charge objects. Consider the two metallic spheres shown in <link target-id="Figure_18_01_induction"/>. The spheres are electrically neutral, so they carry the same amounts of positive and negative charge. In the top picture (<link target-id="Figure_18_01_induction"/>(a)), the two spheres are touching, and the positive and negative charge is evenly distributed over the two spheres. We then approach a glass rod that carries an excess positive charge, which can be done by rubbing the glass rod with silk, as shown in <link target-id="Figure_18_01_induction"/>(b). Because opposite charges attract each other, the negative charge is attracted to the glass rod, leaving an excess positive charge on the opposite side of the right sphere. This is an example of charging by <term>induction</term>, whereby a charge is created by approaching a charged object with a second object to create an unbalanced charge in the second object. If we then separate the two spheres, as shown in <link target-id="Figure_18_01_induction"/>(c), the excess charge is stuck on each sphere. The left sphere now has an excess negative charge, and the right sphere has an excess positive charge. Finally, in the bottom picture, the rod is removed, and the opposite charges attract each other, so they move as close together as they can get.</para>

(b) A positively charged rod approaches, which attracts negative charges, leaving excess positive charge on the right sphere. (c) The spheres are separated. Each sphere now carries an equal magnitude of excess charge. (d) When the positively charged rod is removed, the excess negative charge on the left sphere is attracted to the excess positive charge on the right sphere.</caption></figure><note id="fs-id1167067165558" class="os-teacher">

<para id="fs-id1167063514717"><term class="no-emphasis">Van de Graaff</term> generators are devices that are used not only for serious physics research but also for demonstrating the physics of static electricity at science fairs and in classrooms. Because they deliver relatively little electric current, they can be made safe for use in such environments. The first such generator was built by Robert Van de Graaff in 1931 for use in nuclear physics research. <link target-id="Figure_18_01_VDG"/> shows a simplified sketch of a Van de Graaff generator.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167063868279">Van de Graaff generators use smooth and pointed surfaces and conductors and insulators to generate large static charges. In the version shown in <link target-id="Figure_18_01_VDG"/>, electrons are “sprayed” from the tips of the lower comb onto a moving belt, which is made of an insulating material like, such as rubber. This technique of charging the belt is akin to charging your shoes with electrons by walking across a carpet. The belt raises the charges up to the upper comb, where they transfer again, akin to your touching the doorknob and transferring your charge to it. Because like charges repel, the excess electrons all rush to the outer surface of the globe, which is made of metal (a conductor). Thus, the comb itself never accumulates too much charge, because any charge it gains is quickly depleted by the charge moving to the outer surface of the globe.</para>
<figure id="Figure_18_01_VDG"><media id="fs-id1167066842547" alt="This is a diagram in which two small circles are arranged vertically and are labeled “Upper roller” and “Lower roller”. The two circles are connected by a band labeled “Rubber belt”. A comb-shaped structure touches each circle, and these structures are labeled “Upper comb” and “Lower comb”. The upper circle is in the center of a larger circle labeled “Metal sphere”, and the lower circle is enclosed in a rectangle. A bent line connects the upper comb to the larger circle, and another bent line connects the lower comb to the rectangle and to the ground below the rectangle. A series of minus signs, labeled “Electrons”, is accompanied by a series of arrows, suggesting the flow of electrons from within the rectangle and the lower circle to the upper circle and then to the larger circle.">

<caption>Van de Graaff generators transfer electrons onto a metallic sphere, where the electrons distribute themselves uniformly over the outer surface.</caption></figure><para id="fs-id1167067193283">Van de Graaff generators are used to demonstrate many interesting effects caused by static electricity. By touching the globe, a person gains excess charge, so his or her hair stands on end, as shown in <link target-id="Figure_18_01_VDGman"/>. You can also create mini lightning bolts by moving a neutral conductor toward the globe. Another favorite is to pile up aluminum muffin tins on top of the uncharged globe, then turn on the generator. Being made of conducting material, the tins accumulate excess charge. They then repel each other and fly off the globe one by one. A quick Internet search will show many examples of what you can do with a Van de Graaff generator.</para>
