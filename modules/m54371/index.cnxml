<para id="fs-id1167064905172">In 1917, Albert Einstein was thinking about photons and excited atoms. He considered an atom excited by a certain amount of energy and what would happen if that atom were hit by a photon with the same amount of energy. He suggested that the atom would emit a photon with that amount of energy, and it would be accompanied by the original photon. The exciting part is that you would have <emphasis effect="italics">two</emphasis> photons with the same energy <emphasis effect="italics">and </emphasis>they would be in phase. Those photons could go on to hit other excited atoms, and soon you would have a stream of in-phase photons. Such a light stream is said to be <emphasis effect="italics">coherent</emphasis>. Some four decades later, Einstein’s idea found application in a process called, <emphasis effect="italics">light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation</emphasis>. Take the first letters of all the words (except <emphasis effect="italics">by</emphasis> and “of”) and write them in order. You get the word <term><emphasis effect="italics">laser</emphasis></term> (see <link document="m54369" target-id="Figure_17_01_RayWave"/> (a)), which is the name of the device that produces such a beam of light.</para><para id="fs-id1167065943042">Laser beams are directional, very intense, and narrow (only about 0.5 mm in diameter). These properties lead to a number of applications in industry and medicine. The following are just a few examples:</para>

<list id="fs-id1167064908051"><item>This chapter began with a picture of a compact disc (see <link document="m54376" target-id="Figure_17_00_CDcolors"/>). Those audio and data-storage devices began replacing cassette tapes during the 1990s. CDs are read by interpreting variations in reflections of a laser beam from the surface.</item>
<item>Some barcode scanners use a laser beam.</item>
<item>Lasers are used in industry to cut steel and other metals.</item>
<item>Lasers are bounced off reflectors that astronauts left on the Moon. The time it takes for the light to make the round trip can be used to make precise calculations of the Earth-Moon distance.</item>
<item>Laser beams are used to produce holograms. The name hologram means <emphasis effect="italics">entire picture</emphasis> (from the Greek <emphasis effect="italics">holo-</emphasis>, as in <emphasis effect="italics">holistic</emphasis>), because the image is three-dimensional. A viewer can move around the image and see it from different perspectives. Holograms take advantage of the wave properties of light, as opposed to traditional photography which is based on geometric optics. A holographic image is produced by constructive and destructive interference of a split laser beam.</item>
<item>One of the advantages of using a laser as a surgical tool is that it is accompanied by very little bleeding.</item>
<item>Laser eye surgery has improved the vision of many people, without the need for corrective lenses. A laser beam is used to change the shape of the lens of the eye, thus changing its focal length.</item>

</note><para id="fs-id1167064790615">An interesting thing happens if you pass light through a large number of evenly-spaced parallel slits. Such an arrangement of slits is called a <term>diffraction grating</term>. An interference pattern is created that is very similar to the one formed by double-slit diffraction (see <link document="m54369" target-id="Figure_17_01_2slit2"/> and <link document="m54369" target-id="Figure_17_01_2slit3"/>). A diffraction grating can be manufactured by scratching glass with a sharp tool to form a number of precisely positioned parallel lines, which act like slits. Diffraction gratings work both for transmission of light, as in <link target-id="Figure_17_02_Grating"/>, and for reflection of light, as on the butterfly wings or the Australian opal shown in <link target-id="Figure_17_02_Grating2"/>, or the CD pictured in the opening <link document="m54376" target-id="Figure_17_00_CDcolors">illustration</link> of this chapter. In addition to their use as novelty items, diffraction gratings are commonly used for spectroscopic dispersion and analysis of light. What makes them particularly useful is the fact that they form a sharper pattern than do double slits. That is, their bright regions are narrower and brighter, while their dark regions are darker. <link target-id="Figure_17_02_Grating3"/> shows idealized graphs demonstrating the sharper pattern. Natural diffraction gratings occur in the feathers of certain birds. Tiny, fingerlike structures in regular patterns act as reflection gratings, producing constructive interference that gives the feathers colors not solely due to their pigmentation. The effect is called <term>iridescence</term>.</para><figure id="Figure_17_02_Grating">

<para id="fs-id1167065858873">Can you see the grooves on a CD or DVD (see <link target-id="Figure_17_02_CD"/>)? You may think you can because you know they are there, but they are extremely narrow—1,600 in a millimeter. Because the width of the grooves is similar to wavelengths of visible light, they form a diffraction grating. That is why you see rainbows on a CD.

<para id="fs-id1167066120789">The grooves are actually one continuous groove that spirals outward from the center. Data are recorded in the grooves as binary code (zeroes and ones) in small pits. Information in the pits is detected by a laser that tracks along the groove. It gets even more complicated: The speed of rotation must be varied as the laser tracks toward the circumference so that the linear speed along the groove remains constant. There is also an error correction mechanism to prevent the laser beam from getting off track. A diffraction grating is used to create the first two maxima on either side of the track. If those maxima are not the same distance from the track, an error is indicated and then corrected.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167066136988">Where are diffraction gratings used? Diffraction gratings are key components of <term>monochromators</term>—devices that separate the various wavelengths of incoming light and allow a beam with only a specific wavelength to pass through. Monochromators are used, for example, in optical imaging of particular wavelengths from biological or medical samples. A diffraction grating can be chosen to specifically analyze a wavelength of light emitted by molecules in diseased cells in a biopsy sample, or to help excite strategic molecules in the sample with a selected frequency of light. Another important use is in optical fiber technologies where fibers are designed to provide optimum performance at specific wavelengths. A range of diffraction gratings is available for selecting specific wavelengths for such use.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167064619902">Diffraction gratings are used in spectroscopes to separate a light source into its component wavelengths. When a material is heated to incandescence, it gives off wavelengths of light characteristic of the chemical makeup of the material. A pure substance will produce a spectrum that is unique, thus allowing identification of the substance. Spectroscopes are also used to measure wavelengths both shorter and longer than visible light. Such instruments have become especially useful to astronomers and chemists. <link target-id="Figure_17_02_Spectroscp"/> shows a diagram of a spectroscope.</para>

Those arrows in turn strike the second circular arc, labeled as one of the “mirrors,” which is concave to the left and slightly upward. From the second mirror, five colored arrows fan out to the left and slightly downward to form a wider triangle, and they strike a vertical surface labeled “detector.” The purple arrow strikes the top of the detector and the blue arrow slightly below it.

<para id="fs-id1167066034659">There are many situations in which diffraction limits the resolution. The acuity of vision is limited because light passes through the pupil, the circular aperture of the eye.

Thus light passing through a lens with a diameter of <emphasis effect="italics">D </emphasis>shows the diffraction effect and spreads, blurring the image, just as light passing through an aperture of diameter <emphasis effect="italics">D </emphasis>does. Diffraction limits the resolution of any system having a lens or mirror.

To answer that question, consider the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture, which, similar to the diffraction pattern of light passing through a slit, has a central maximum that is wider and brighter than the maxima surrounding it (see <link target-id="Figure_17_02_Resolution"/> (a)).
