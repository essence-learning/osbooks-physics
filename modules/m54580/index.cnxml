<para id="fs-id1167067019875">There is an ongoing quest to find the substructures of matter. At one time, it was thought that atoms would be the ultimate substructure. However, just when the first direct evidence of atoms was obtained, it became clear that they have a substructure and a tiny nucleus. The nucleus itself has spectacular characteristics. For example, certain nuclei are unstable, and their decay emits radiations with energies millions of times greater than atomic energies. Some of the mysteries of nature, such as why the core of Earth remains molten and how the Sun produces its energy, are explained by nuclear phenomena. The exploration of radioactivity and the nucleus has revealed new fundamental particles, forces, and conservation laws. That exploration has evolved into a search for further underlying structures, such as quarks. In this section, we will explore the fundamentals of the nucleus and nuclear radioactivity.</para>
<section id="fs-id1167063616797">
<title>The Structure of the Nucleus</title>
<para id="fs-id1167066848759">At this point, you are likely familiar with the neutron and proton, the two fundamental particles that make up the nucleus of an atom. Those two particles, collectively called <term>nucleons</term>, make up the small interior portion of the atom. Both particles have nearly the same mass, although the neutron is about two parts in 1,000 more massive. The mass of a proton is equivalent to 1,836 electrons, while the mass of a neutron is equivalent to that of 1,839 electrons. That said, each of the particles is significantly more massive than the electron.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167067088207">When describing the mass of objects on the scale of nucleons and atoms, it is most reasonable to measure their mass in terms of atoms. The atomic mass unit (u) was originally defined so that a neutral carbon atom would have a mass of exactly 12 u. Given that protons and neutrons are approximately the same mass, that there are six protons and six neutrons in a carbon atom, and that the mass of an electron is minuscule in comparison, measuring this way allows for both protons and neutrons to have masses close to 1 u. <link target-id="Table_22_01"/> shows the mass of protons, neutrons, and electrons on the new scale. </para>

<note id="fs-id1167066790901" class="tips-for-success">

<para id="fs-id1167061330660">For most conceptual situations, the difference in mass between the proton and neutron is insubstantial. In fact, for calculations that require fewer than four significant digits, both the proton and neutron masses may be considered equivalent to one atomic mass unit. However, when determining the amount of energy released in a nuclear reaction, as in <link target-id="Worked_Example_22_05"/>, the difference in mass cannot be ignored.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167067019330">To more completely characterize nuclei, let us also consider two other important quantities: the atomic number and the mass number. The <term>atomic number</term>, <emphasis effect="italics">Z</emphasis>, represents the number of protons within a nucleus. That value determines the elemental quality of each atom. Every carbon atom, for instance, has a <emphasis effect="italics">Z</emphasis> value of 6, whereas every oxygen atom has a <emphasis effect="italics">Z</emphasis> value of 8. For clarification, only oxygen atoms may have a <emphasis effect="italics">Z</emphasis> value of 8. If the <emphasis effect="italics">Z</emphasis> value is not 8, the atom cannot be oxygen.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167067078734">The <term>mass number</term>, <emphasis effect="italics">A</emphasis>, represents the total number of protons and neutrons, or nucleons, within an atom. For an ordinary carbon atom the mass number would be 12, as there are typically six neutrons accompanying the six protons within the atom. In the case of carbon, the mass would be exactly 12 u. For oxygen, with a mass number of 16, the atomic mass is 15.994915 u. Of course, the difference is minor and can be ignored for most scenarios. Again, because the mass of an electron is so small compared to the nucleons, the mass number and the atomic mass can be essentially equivalent. <link target-id="Figure_22_02_Lithium"/> shows an example of Lithium-7, which has an atomic number of 3 and a mass number of 7.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167067201861"><span>[BL]</span>Students may confuse the terms <emphasis effect="italics">mass number</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">atomic number</emphasis>. Remind them that the mass is based on both protons and neutrons and so mass number is a measure of both combined. The atomic number differentiates between two different atoms, which only protons can do. A few examples showing pictures of nuclei and having students identify the mass and atomic numbers of each should help.</para>
</note>

<para id="fs-id1167067098651">How does the mass number help to differentiate one atom from another? If each atom of carbon has an atomic number of 6, then what is the value of including the mass number at all? The intent of the mass number is to differentiate between various isotopes of an atom. The term <term>isotope</term> refers to the variation of atoms based upon the number of neutrons within their nucleus. While it is most common for there to be six neutrons accompanying the six protons within a carbon atom, it is possible to find carbon atoms with seven neutrons or eight neutrons. Those carbon atoms are respectively referred to as carbon-13 and carbon-14 atoms, with their mass numbers being their primary distinction. The isotope distinction is an important one to make, as the number of neutrons within an atom can affect a number of its properties, not the least of which is nuclear stability.</para>

<title>Radioactivity and Nuclear Forces</title>
<para id="fs-id1167060070546">In 1896, the French physicist <term class="no-emphasis">Antoine Henri Becquerel</term> (1852–1908) noticed something strange. When a uranium-rich mineral called pitchblende was placed on a completely opaque envelope containing a photographic plate, it darkened spots on the photographic plate.. Becquerel reasoned that the pitchblende must emit invisible rays capable of penetrating the opaque material. Stranger still was that no light was shining on the pitchblende, which means that the pitchblende was emitting the invisible rays continuously without having any energy input! There is an apparent violation of the law of conservation of energy, one that scientists can now explain using Einstein’s famous equation  <m:math>

  </m:mrow>
</m:math>  It was soon evident that Becquerel’s rays originate in the nuclei of the atoms and have other unique characteristics.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167063606216">To this point, most reactions you have studied have been chemical reactions, which are reactions involving the electrons surrounding the atoms. However, two types of experimental evidence implied that Becquerel’s rays did not originate with electrons, but instead within the nucleus of an atom.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167066831128">First, the radiation is found to be only associated with certain elements, such as uranium. Whether uranium was in the form of an element or compound was irrelevant to its radiation. In addition, the presence of radiation does not vary with temperature, pressure, or ionization state of the uranium atom. Since all of those factors affect electrons in an atom, the radiation cannot come from electron transitions, as atomic spectra do.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167066800344">The huge energy emitted during each event is the second piece of evidence that the radiation cannot be atomic. Nuclear radiation has energies on the order of 10<sup>6</sup> eV per event, which is much greater than typical atomic energies that are a few eV, such as those observed in spectra and chemical reactions, and more than ten times as high as the most energetic X-rays.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167067176158">To emphasize the point that most reactions are chemical, have students brainstorm a list of reactions from chemistry class. Have them describe the changes that cause the reactions to take place. Are the reactions the result of nuclear interactions or electron interactions?</para>
</note>

<para id="fs-id1167067305006">But why would reactions within the nucleus take place? And what would cause an apparently stable structure to begin emitting energy? Was there something special about Becquerel’s uranium-rich pitchblende? To answer those questions, it is necessary to look into the structure of the nucleus. Though it is perhaps surprising, you will find that many of the same principles that we observe on a macroscopic level still apply to the nucleus.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167067061344">So what forces hold a nucleus together? After all, the nucleus is very small and its protons, being positive, should exert tremendous repulsive forces on one another. Considering that, it seems that the nucleus would be forced apart, not together!</para>
<para id="fs-id1167067210142">The answer is that a previously unknown force holds the nucleus together and makes it into a tightly packed ball of nucleons. This force is known as the <term>strong nuclear force</term>. The strong force has such a short range that it quickly fall to zero over a distance of only 10<sup>–15</sup> meters. However, like glue, it is very strong when the nucleons get close to one another.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167067176394">Understanding why the nucleus would break apart can be partially explained using <link target-id="Table_22_02"/>. The balance between the strong nuclear force and the electromagnetic force is a tenuous one. Recall that the attractive strong nuclear force exists between any two nucleons and acts over a very short range while the weaker repulsive electromagnetic force only acts between protons, although over a larger range. Considering the interactions, an imperfect balance between neutrons and protons can result in a nuclear reaction, with the result of regaining equilibrium.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167066870470">Alpha decay refers to the type of decay that takes place when too many protons exist in the nucleus. It is the most common type of decay and causes the nucleus to regain equilibrium between its two competing internal forces. During alpha decay, the nucleus ejects two protons and two neutrons, allowing the strong nuclear force to regain balance with the repulsive electromagnetic force. The nuclear equation for an alpha decay process can be shown as follows.</para>

<item>Note that the two protons and two neutrons ejected from the nucleus combine to form a helium nucleus. Shortly after decay, the ejected helium ion typically acquires two electrons to become a stable helium atom.</item>
<item>Finally, it is important to see that, despite the elemental change, physical conservation still takes place. The mass number of the new element and the alpha particle together equal the mass number of the original element. Also, the net charge of all particles involved remains the same before and after the transmutation.</item>

As a result, they have a short range and short penetrating distance in most materials. Beta particles, being slightly less charged, have a larger range and larger penetrating distance. Gamma rays, on the other hand, have little electric interaction with particles and travel much farther. Two diagrams below show the importance of difference in penetration. <link target-id="Table_22_03"/> shows the distance of radiation penetration, and <link target-id="Figure_22_02_RadPen"/> shows the influence various factors have on radiation penetration distance.</para>

<title>Radiation Detectors</title>
<para id="fs-id1167063820980">The first direct detection of radiation was Becquerel’s darkened photographic plate. Photographic film is still the most common detector of ionizing radiation, being used routinely in medical and dental X-rays. Nuclear radiation can also be captured on film, as seen in <link target-id="Figure_22_02_PhotoFilm"/>. The mechanism for film exposure by radiation is similar to that by photons. A quantum of energy from a radioactive particle interacts with the emulsion and alters it chemically, thus exposing the film. Provided the radiation has more than the few eV of energy needed to induce the chemical change, the chemical alteration will occur. The amount of film darkening is related to the type of radiation and amount of exposure. The process is not 100 percent efficient, since not all incident radiation interacts and not all interactions produce the chemical change.</para>

<caption>Film badges contain film similar to that used in this dental X-ray film. It is sandwiched between various absorbers to determine the penetrating ability of the radiation as well as the amount. Film badges are worn to determine radiation exposure.

<para id="fs-id1167066966916">Another very common radiation detector is the <term>Geiger tube</term>. The clicking and buzzing sound we hear in dramatizations and documentaries, as well as in our own physics labs, is usually an audio output of events detected by a Geiger counter. These relatively inexpensive radiation detectors are based on the simple and sturdy Geiger tube, shown schematically in <link target-id="Figure_22_02_Geiger"/>. A conducting cylinder with a wire along its axis is filled with an insulating gas so that a voltage applied between the cylinder and wire produces almost no current. Ionizing radiation passing through the tube produces free ion pairs that are attracted to the wire and cylinder, forming a current that is detected as a count. Not every particle is detected, since some radiation can pass through without producing enough ionization. However, Geiger counters are very useful in producing a prompt output that reveals the existence and relative intensity of ionizing radiation.</para>

Ions move toward the cylinder and electrons toward the wire. The resulting current is detected and registered as a count.</caption>
</figure>

<para id="fs-id1167067028510">Another radiation detection method records light produced when radiation interacts with materials. The energy of the radiation is sufficient to excite atoms in a material that may fluoresce, such as the phosphor used by Rutherford’s group. Materials called <term>scintillators</term> use a more complex process to convert radiation energy into light. Scintillators may be liquid or solid, and they can be very efficient. Their light output can provide information about the energy, charge, and type of radiation. Scintillator light flashes are very brief in duration, allowing the detection of a huge number of particles in short periods of time. Scintillation detectors are used in a variety of research and diagnostic applications. Among those are the detection of the radiation from distant galaxies using satellite-mounted equipment and the detection of exotic particles in accelerator laboratories.</para>
