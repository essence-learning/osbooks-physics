<title>Maxwell’s Equations</title>
<para id="fs-id1167064948318">The Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879) is regarded widely to have been the greatest theoretical physicist of the nineteenth century. Although he died young, Maxwell not only formulated a complete electromagnetic theory, represented by <term>Maxwell’s equations</term>, he also developed the kinetic theory of gases, and made significant contributions to the understanding of color vision and the nature of Saturn’s rings.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065820461">Maxwell brought together all the work that had been done by brilliant physicists, such as Ørsted, Coulomb, Ampere, Gauss, and Faraday, and added his own insights to develop the overarching theory of electromagnetism. Maxwell’s equations are paraphrased here in words because their mathematical content is beyond the level of this text. However, the equations illustrate how apparently simple mathematical statements can elegantly unite and express a multitude of concepts—why mathematics is the language of science.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065044286">Maxwell’s Equations</para>
<list id="fs-id1167062509638" list-type="enumerated">
<item>Electric field lines originate on positive charges and terminate on negative charges. The electric field is defined as the force per unit charge on a test charge, and the strength of the force is related to the electric constant, <emphasis effect="italics">ε</emphasis><sub>0</sub>.</item>
<item>Magnetic field lines are continuous, having no beginning or end. No magnetic monopoles are known to exist. The strength of the magnetic force is related to the magnetic constant, <emphasis effect="italics">μ</emphasis><sub>0</sub>.</item>
<item>A changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force (emf) and, hence, an electric field. The direction of the emf opposes the change, changing direction of the magnetic field.</item>
<item>Magnetic fields are generated by moving charges or by changing electric fields.</item>
</list>

<para id="fs-id1167065861460">Maxwell’s complete theory shows that electric and magnetic forces are not separate, but different manifestations of the same thing—the electromagnetic force. This classical unification of forces is one motivation for current attempts to unify the four basic forces in nature—the gravitational, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear forces. The weak nuclear and electromagnetic forces have been unified, and further unification with the strong nuclear force is expected; but, the unification of the gravitational force with the other three has proven to be a real head-scratcher.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167064707478">One final accomplishment of Maxwell was his development in 1855 of a process that could produce color photographic images. In 1861, he and photographer Thomas Sutton worked together on this process. The color image was achieved by projecting red, blue, and green light through black-and-white photographs of a tartan ribbon, each photo itself exposed in different-colored light. The final image was projected onto a screen (see <link target-id="Figure_15_01_FirstColor"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-id1167065849096">Features that encouraged mathematicians and physicists to accept Maxwell’s equations is that they are seen as being both elegant and—considering the difference between an electric charge and a magnetic dipole, which give rise to the respective fields—essentially symmetrical. When scientists are looking for an approach to developing a new theory, they usually begin with the simplest and most symmetrical explanations. An example of such symmetry is the fact that electrons and protons have equal and opposite charges. You can see the symmetry in the four statements, given above, that describe the equations. The first two statements show a similar treatment of electric and magnetic fields, and the last two describe how a magnetic field can generate an electric field, and vice versa. </para>
<para id="fs-id1167064994250">From our present-day perspective, we can now see the significance of Maxwell’s equations. This was the first step in the quest to unify all natural forces under one theory. After Maxwell unified the electric and magnetic forces as the electromagnetic force, others unified this force with the weak nuclear force, and there is evidence that the strong nuclear force can be unified with the <emphasis effect="italics">electroweak</emphasis> force. The only force that has resisted unification with the others is the gravitational force. A theory that would unify all forces is often referred as a <emphasis effect="italics">grand unified theory</emphasis> or a <emphasis effect="italics">theory of everything</emphasis>. The quest for such a theory is still underway.</para>

The basic difference between types of radiation is their differing frequencies. Each frequency has an associated wavelength. As frequency increases across the spectrum, wavelength decreases. Energy also increases with frequency. Because of this, higher frequencies penetrate matter more readily.

<para id="fs-id1167065863709">As a child, you probably learned the color wheel, shown on the left in <link target-id="Figure_15_01_Color"/>. It helps if you know what color results when you mix different colors of paint together. Mixing two of the primary <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">pigment</emphasis></term> colors—magenta, yellow, or cyan—together results in a secondary color. For example, mixing cyan and yellow makes green. This is called <emphasis effect="italics">subtractive</emphasis> color mixing. Mixing different colors of <emphasis effect="italics">light</emphasis> together is quite different. The diagram on the right shows <emphasis effect="italics">additive</emphasis> color mixing. In this case, the primary colors are red, green, and blue, and the secondary colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow. Mixing pigments and mixing light are different because materials absorb light by a different set of rules than does the perception of light by the eye. Notice that, when all colors are subtracted, the result is no color, or black. When all colors are added, the result is white light. We see the reverse of this when white sunlight is separated into the visible spectrum by a prism or by raindrops when a rainbow appears in the sky.</para>

<title>Animal Color Perception</title>
<para id="fs-id1167065073193">The physics of color perception has interesting links to zoology. Other animals have very different views of the world than humans, especially with respect to which colors can be seen. Color is detected by cells in the eye called <emphasis effect="italics">cones</emphasis>. Humans have three cones that are sensitive to three different ranges of electromagnetic wavelengths. They are called red, blue, and green cones, although these colors do not correspond exactly to the centers of the three ranges. The ranges of wavelengths that each cone detects are red, 500 to 700 nm; green, 450 to 630 nm; and blue, 400 to 500 nm.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167066188849">Most primates also have three kinds of cones and see the world much as we do. Most mammals other than primates only have two cones and have a less colorful view of things. Dogs, for example see blue and yellow, but are color blind to red and green. You might think that <emphasis effect="italics">simpler</emphasis> species, such as fish and insects, would have less sophisticated vision, but this is not the case. Many birds, reptiles, amphibians, and insects have four or five different cones in their eyes. These species don’t have a wider range of perceived colors, but they see more hues, or combinations of colors. Also, some animals, such as bees or rattlesnakes, see a range of colors that is as broad as ours, but shifted into the ultraviolet or infrared.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065013759">These differences in color perception are generally adaptations that help the animals survive. Colorful tropical birds and fish display some colors that are too subtle for us to see.

<para id="fs-id1167065704583">The low-frequency, infrared region of the spectrum has many applications in media broadcasting.

The rotational energy of these molecules is given up to surrounding matter as heat. The first microwave ovens were called <emphasis effect="italics">Radaranges</emphasis> because they were based on radar technology  developed during World War II.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167066037692"><term class="no-emphasis">Radar</term> uses radiation with wavelengths similar to those of microwaves to detect the location and speed of distant objects, such as airplanes, weather formations, and motor vehicles. Radar information is obtained by receiving and analyzing the echoes of microwaves reflected by an object. The speed of the object can be measured using the Doppler shift of the returning waves. This is the same effect you learned about when you studied sound waves. Like sound waves, EM waves are shifted to higher frequencies by an object moving toward an observer, and to lower frequencies by an object moving away from the observer. Astronomers use this same Doppler effect to measure the speed at which distant galaxies are moving away from us. In this case, the shift in frequency is called the <emphasis effect="italics">red shift</emphasis>, because visible frequencies are shifted toward the lower-frequency, red end of the spectrum.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167065968183">Exposure to any radiation with frequencies greater than those of visible light carries some health hazards. All types of radiation in this range are known to cause cell damage. The danger is related to the high energy and penetrating ability of these EM waves. The likelihood of being harmed by any of this radiation depends largely on the amount of exposure. Most people try to reduce exposure to UV radiation from sunlight by using sunscreen and protective clothing. Physicians still use X-rays to diagnose medical problems, but the intensity of the radiation used is extremely low. <link target-id="Figure_15_01_X-ray"/> shows an X-ray image of a patient’s chest cavity.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167066112286">One medical-imaging technique that involves no danger of exposure is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is an important imaging and research tool in medicine, producing highly detailed two- and three-dimensional images.
