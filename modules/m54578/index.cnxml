<title>Medical Applications of Nuclear Physics</title>

<title>Medical Imaging</title>
<para id="fs-id1167067011989">A host of medical imaging techniques employ nuclear radiation. What makes nuclear radiation so useful? First,  <m:math>
 <m:mi>γ</m:mi>
</m:math>  radiation can easily penetrate tissue; hence, it is a useful probe to monitor conditions inside the body. Second, nuclear radiation depends on the nuclide and not on the chemical compound it is in, so that a radioactive nuclide can be put into a compound designed for specific purposes. When that is done, the compound is said to be <term>tagged</term>. A tagged compound used for medical purposes is called a <term>radiopharmaceutical</term>. Radiation detectors external to the body can determine the location and concentration of a radiopharmaceutical to yield medically useful information. For example, certain drugs are concentrated in inflamed regions of the body, and their locations can aid diagnosis and treatment as seen in <link target-id="Figure_22_05_Radiopharm"/>. Another application utilizes a radiopharmaceutical that the body sends to bone cells, particularly those that are most active, to detect cancerous tumors or healing points. Images can then be produced of such bone scans. Clever use of radioisotopes determines the functioning of body organs, such as blood flow, heart muscle activity, and iodine uptake in the thyroid gland. For instance, a radioactive form of iodine can be used to monitor the thyroid, a radioactive thallium salt can be used to follow the blood stream, and radioactive gallium can be used for cancer imaging.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167067087712">Once a radioactive compound has been ingested, a device like that shown in <link target-id="Figure_22_05_Anger"/> is used to monitor nuclear activity. The device, called an <term>Anger camera</term> or gamma camera uses a piece of lead with holes bored through it. The gamma rays are redirected through the collimator to narrow their beam, and are then interpreted using a device called a scintillator. The computer analysis of detector signals produces an image. One of the disadvantages of this detection method is that there is no depth information (i.e., it provides a two-dimensional view of the tumor as opposed to a three-dimensional view), because radiation from any location under that detector produces a signal.</para>

<title>Ionizing Radiation on the Body</title>
<para id="fs-id1167066966588">We hear many seemingly contradictory things about the biological effects of <term class="no-emphasis">ionizing radiation</term>. It can cause cancer, burns, and hair loss, and yet it is used to treat and even cure cancer. How do we understand such effects? Once again, there is an underlying simplicity in nature, even in complicated biological organisms. All the effects of ionizing radiation on biological tissue can be understood by knowing that ionizing radiation affects molecules within cells, particularly DNA molecules. Let us take a brief look at molecules within cells and how cells operate. Cells have long, double-helical DNA molecules containing chemical patterns called genetic codes that govern the function and processes undertaken by the cells. Damage to DNA consists of breaks in chemical bonds or other changes in the structural features of the DNA chain, leading to changes in the genetic code. In human cells, we can have as many as a million individual instances of damage to DNA per cell per day. The repair ability of DNA is vital for maintaining the integrity of the genetic code and for the normal functioning of the entire organism. A cell with a damaged ability to repair DNA, which could have been induced by ionizing radiation, can do one of the following:</para>

<list id="fs-id1167067082798">
<item>The cell can go into an irreversible state of dormancy, known as senescence.</item>
<item>The cell can commit suicide, known as programmed cell death.</item>
<item>The cell can go into unregulated cell division, leading to tumors and cancers.</item>
</list>

<para id="fs-id1167067264239"><span>[BL]</span><span>[OL]</span>Why does radiation cause damage to DNA? Have students view the disruption due to the energy that radiation carries. Emphasize that ionizing radiation is just radiation with enough energy to affect the structural makeup of a cell (i.e., to ionize means to effect electrons).</para>
</note>

<para id="fs-id1167061444290">Since ionizing radiation damages the DNA, ionizing radiation has its greatest effect on cells that rapidly reproduce, including most types of cancer. Thus, cancer cells are more sensitive to radiation than normal cells and can be killed by it easily. Cancer is characterized by a malfunction of cell reproduction, and can also be caused by ionizing radiation. There is no contradiction to say that ionizing radiation can be both a cure and a cause.</para>

<title>Radiotherapy</title>
<para id="fs-id1167061683228"><term class="no-emphasis">Radiotherapy</term> is effective against cancer because cancer cells reproduce rapidly and, consequently, are more sensitive to radiation. The central problem in radiotherapy is to make the dose for cancer cells as high as possible while limiting the dose for normal cells. The ratio of abnormal cells killed to normal cells killed is called the <term>therapeutic ratio</term>, and all radiotherapy techniques are designed to enhance that ratio. Radiation can be concentrated in cancerous tissue by a number of techniques. One of the most prevalent techniques for well-defined tumors is a geometric technique shown in <link target-id="Figure_22_05_Radio"/>. A narrow beam of radiation is passed through the patient from a variety of directions with a common crossing point in the tumor. The technique concentrates the dose in the tumor while spreading it out over a large volume of normal tissue.</para>

<figure id="Figure_22_05_Radio"><media id="fs-id1167067184600" alt="The figure shows the use of radiotherapy for treating tumors. A patient is lying and gamma rays are passed through him from several directions and concentrated on the tumor point."><image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/CNX_HSPhysics_22_05_Radio.jpg"/></media>
<caption>The <sup>60</sup>Co source of  <m:math>
 <m:mi>γ</m:mi>
</m:math> -radiation is rotated around the patient so that the common crossing point is in the tumor, concentrating the dose there. This geometric technique works for well-defined tumors.</caption>
</figure>

<para id="fs-id1167063537722">Another use of radiation therapy is through radiopharmaceuticals. Cleverly, radiopharmaceuticals are used in cancer therapy by tagging antibodies with radioisotopes. Those antibodies are extracted from the patient, cultured, loaded with a radioisotope, and then returned to the patient. The antibodies are then concentrated almost entirely in the tissue they developed to fight, thus localizing the radiation in abnormal tissue. This method is used with radioactive iodine to fight thyroid cancer. While the therapeutic ratio can be quite high for such short-range radiation, there can be a significant dose for organs that eliminate radiopharmaceuticals from the body, such as the liver, kidneys, and bladder. As with most radiotherapy, the technique is limited by the tolerable amount of damage to the normal tissue.</para>

<title>Radiation Dosage</title>
<para id="fs-id1167061706174">
To quantitatively discuss the biological effects of ionizing radiation, we need a radiation dose unit that is directly related to those effects.

<item>Most evacuees of Chernobyl received radiation doses of less than 50 mSv, although a few received more than 100 mSv. However, radiation doses on the day of the accident exceeded 20,000 mSv, and some workers tasked to clean up the site after the accident had doses greater than 500 mSv.</item>
<item>Regarding the Fukushima meltdownNo harmful health effects were found in 195,345 residents living in the vicinity of the plant who were screened by the end of May 2011. All the 1,080 children tested for thyroid gland exposure showed results within safe limits, according to the report submitted to IAEA in June. By December, government health checks of some 1,700 residents who were evacuated from three municipalities showed that two thirds received an external radiation dose within the normal international limit of 1 mSv/yr, 98 percent were below 5 mSv/yr, and ten people were exposed to more than 10 mSv. </item>
<item>As regulated by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, the maximum permissible amount of radiation exposure during a twelve-month period is 5 rem. Additional regulations exist for pregnant females.</item>
