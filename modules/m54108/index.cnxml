    <title>Defining Motion</title>
    <para id="fs-id1167066850203">Our study of physics opens with <term>kinematics</term>—the study of <term class="no-emphasis">motion</term> without considering its causes. Objects are in motion everywhere you look. Everything from a tennis game to a space-probe flyby of the planet Neptune involves motion. When you are resting, your heart moves blood through your veins. Even in inanimate objects, atoms are always moving.</para>
    <para id="fs-id1167066820976">How do you know something is moving? The location of an object at any particular time is its <term>position</term>. More precisely, you need to specify its position relative to a convenient <term>reference frame</term>. Earth is often used as a reference frame, and we often describe the position of an object as it relates to <term class="no-emphasis">stationary</term> objects in that reference frame. For example, a rocket launch would be described in terms of the position of the rocket with respect to Earth as a whole, while a professor’s position could be described in terms of where she is in relation to the nearby white board. In other cases, we use reference frames that are not stationary but are in motion relative to Earth. To describe the position of a person in an airplane, for example, we use the airplane, not Earth, as the reference frame. (See <link target-id="Figure_02_01_Airplane"/>.) Thus, you can only know how fast and in what <term class="no-emphasis">direction</term> an object's position is changing against a background of something else that is either not moving or moving with a known <term class="no-emphasis">speed</term> and direction. The reference frame is the coordinate system from which the positions of objects are described. </para>

    <para id="fs-id1167067092685">Your classroom can be used as a reference frame. In the classroom, the walls are not moving. Your motion as you walk to the door, can be measured against the stationary background of the classroom walls. You can also tell if other things in the classroom are moving, such as your classmates entering the classroom or a book falling off a desk. You can also tell in what direction something is moving in the classroom. You might say, “The teacher is moving toward the door.” Your reference frame allows you to determine not only that something is moving but also the direction of motion. </para>

Walk once across the room between the student and the rest of the class. Ask the student and others in the class to describe the direction of your motion. The class might describe your motion as <emphasis effect="italics">to the right</emphasis>, but the student who is standing as a background to your motion would describe the motion as <emphasis effect="italics">to the left</emphasis>.

</caption></figure><para id="fs-id1167067139129">The idea that a description of motion depends on the reference frame of the observer has been known for hundreds of years. The 17<sup>th</sup>-century astronomer <term class="no-emphasis">Galileo</term> Galilei (<link target-id="Figure_02_01_Galileo"/>) was one of the first scientists to explore this idea. Galileo suggested the following thought experiment: Imagine a windowless ship moving at a constant speed and direction along a perfectly calm sea. Is there a way that a person inside the ship can determine whether the ship is moving? You can extend this thought experiment by also imagining a person standing on the shore. How can a person on the shore determine whether the ship is moving?</para>
      <para id="fs-id1167066864742">Galileo came to an amazing conclusion. Only by looking at each other can a person in the ship or a person on shore describe the motion of one relative to the other. In addition, their descriptions of motion would be identical. A person inside the ship would describe the person on the land as moving past the ship. The person on shore would describe the ship and the person inside it as moving past. Galileo realized that observers moving at a constant speed and direction relative to each other describe motion in the same way. Galileo had discovered that a description of motion is only meaningful if you specify a reference frame.</para>

        Now imagine driving from your house to a friend's house located several kilometers away. How far would you drive?

When you are describing the entire round trip, distance and displacement are different.

However, when you describe the displacement, you take into account both the magnitude of the change in position and the direction of movement.</para>

It was supposed to orbit the planet and take readings from a safe distance. The American scientists made calculations in English units (feet, inches, pounds, etc.) and forgot to convert their answers to the standard metric SI units. This was a very costly mistake. Instead of orbiting the planet as planned, the Mars Climate Orbiter ended up flying into the Martian atmosphere. The probe disintegrated.

In this case, the Mars Climate Orbiter’s orbit needed to be calculated precisely because its machinery was designed to withstand only a certain amount of atmospheric pressure. The orbiter had to be close enough to the planet to take measurements and far enough away that it could remain structurally sound. One way to teach this concept would be to pick an orbital distance from Mars and have the students calculate the distance of the path and the height from the surface both in SI units and in English units. Ask why failure to convert might be a problem.</para>
