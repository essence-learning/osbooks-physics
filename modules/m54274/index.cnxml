    <para id="fs-id1167066832715"><term>Simple machines</term> make work easier, but they do not decrease the amount of work you have to do. Why can’t simple machines change the amount of work that you do? Recall that in closed systems the total amount of energy is conserved. A machine cannot increase the amount of energy you put into it. So, why is a simple machine useful? Although it cannot change the amount of work you do, a simple machine can change the amount of force you must apply to an object, and the distance over which you apply the force. In most cases, a simple machine is used to reduce the amount of force you must exert to do work. The down side is that you must exert the force over a greater distance, because the product of force and distance, <emphasis>f</emphasis><emphasis effect="italics">d</emphasis>, (which equals work) does not change.</para>
    <para id="fs-id1167066791981">Let’s examine how this works in practice. In <link target-id="Figure_09_03_lever"/>(a), the worker uses a type of <term>lever</term> to exert a small force over a large distance, while the pry bar pulls up on the nail with a large force over a small distance. <link target-id="Figure_09_03_lever"/>(b) shows the how a lever works mathematically. The effort force, applied at <emphasis>F<sub>e</sub></emphasis>, lifts the load (the resistance force) which is pushing down at <emphasis>F</emphasis><sub><emphasis effect="italics">r</emphasis></sub>. The triangular pivot is called the <term class="no-emphasis">fulcrum</term>; the part of the lever between the fulcrum and <emphasis>F</emphasis><sub><emphasis effect="italics">e</emphasis></sub> is the effort arm, <emphasis effect="italics">L<sub>e</sub></emphasis>; and the part to the left is the resistance arm, <emphasis effect="italics">L<sub>r</sub></emphasis>. The <term>mechanical advantage</term> is a number that tells us how many times a simple machine multiplies the effort force. The <term>ideal mechanical advantage</term>, <emphasis effect="italics">IMA</emphasis>, is the mechanical advantage of a perfect machine with no loss of useful work caused by friction between moving parts. The equation for <emphasis effect="italics">IMA</emphasis> is shown in <link target-id="Figure_09_03_lever"/>(b).</para><figure id="Figure_09_03_lever">

The last pulley system shows four pulleys holding a mass with a hook. A force vector, F e, points downward from the pulley. N equals four is shown.">

The input and output distances are easier to see for the lever, inclined plane and wedge. The other three are not as obvious. For a pulley system, the input distance is how far you pull the rope, and the output distance is the distance the load rises. For a wheel and axle, the input distance is the circumference of the wheel, and the output distance is the circumference of the axle. For a screw, the input distance is the circumference of the circle over which the force is applied, and the output distance is the distance between the screw threads.</para>
