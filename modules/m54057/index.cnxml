Teachers could ask students how gravity affects life on Earth. Students will likely mention how gravity keeps us on Earth’s surface. Prompt them, if necessary, to also think about Earth’s orbital motion around the sun. This motion allows Earth to bask in the warmth of the sun’s light. Without the Sun’s gravity, Earth would continue moving in a straight line and move away from the sun, while people would float off of Earth’s surface. The orbit of the moon could also be brought into this discussion, because Earth’s gravity keeps the moon moving around Earth rather than continuing in a straight path.</para>
</note><section id="fs-id1164354587065"><title>What Physics Is</title><para id="fs-id1164353488300">Think about all of the technological devices that you use on a regular basis. Computers, wireless internet, smart phones, tablets, global positioning system (GPS), MP3 players, and satellite radio might come to mind. Next, think about the most exciting modern technologies that you have heard about in the news, such as trains that levitate above their tracks, <emphasis effect="italics">invisibility cloaks</emphasis> that bend light around them, and microscopic robots that fight diseased cells in our bodies. All of these groundbreaking advancements rely on the principles of <term>physics</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1169316365038">Physics is a branch of science. The word <emphasis effect="italics">science</emphasis> comes from a Latin word that means <emphasis effect="italics">having knowledge</emphasis>, and refers the knowledge of how the physical world operates, based on objective evidence determined through observation and experimentation. A key requirement of any scientific explanation of a natural phenomenon is that it must be testable; one must be able to devise and conduct an experimental investigation that either supports or refutes the explanation. It is important to note that some questions fall outside the realm of science precisely because they deal with phenomena that are not scientifically testable. This need for objective evidence helps define the investigative process scientists follow, which will be described later in this chapter.</para>
<para id="fs-id1164354537908">Physics is the science aimed at describing the fundamental aspects of our universe. This includes what things are in it, what properties of those things are noticeable, and what processes those things or their properties undergo. In simpler terms, physics attempts to describe the basic mechanisms that make our universe behave the way it does. For example, consider a smart phone (<link target-id="Figure_01_01_phone"/>). Physics describes how electric current interacts with the various circuits inside the device. This knowledge helps engineers select the appropriate materials and circuit layout when building the smart phone. Next, consider a GPS. Physics describes the relationship between the speed of an object, the distance over which it travels, and the time it takes to travel that distance. When you use a GPS device in a vehicle, it utilizes these physics relationships to determine the travel time from one location to another.</para>

<para id="fs-id1164354471453">As our technology evolved over the centuries, physics expanded into many branches. Ancient peoples could only study things that they could see with the naked eye or otherwise experience without the aid of scientific equipment. This included the study of <term class="no-emphasis">kinematics</term>, which is the study of moving objects. For example, ancient people often studied the apparent motion of objects in the sky, such as the sun, moon, and stars. This is evident in the construction of prehistoric astronomical observatories, such as Stonehenge in England (shown in <link target-id="Figure_01_01_Stonehenge"/>). </para>

<para id="fs-id1164354617452">Ancient people also studied <term class="no-emphasis">statics</term> and <term class="no-emphasis">dynamics</term>, which focus on how objects start moving, stop moving, and change speed and direction in response to forces that push or pull on the objects. This early interest in kinematics and dynamics allowed humans to invent simple machines, such as the lever, the pulley, the ramp, and the wheel. These simple machines were gradually combined and integrated to produce more complicated machines, such as wagons and cranes. Machines allowed humans to gradually do more work more effectively in less time, allowing them to create larger and more complicated buildings and structures, many of which still exist today from ancient times.</para>



<para id="fs-id1164354554377">As technology advanced, the branches of physics diversified even more. These include branches such as <term class="no-emphasis">acoustics</term>, the study of sound, and <term class="no-emphasis">optics</term>, the study of the light. In 1608, the invention of the telescope by a Germany spectacle maker, Hans Lippershey, led to huge breakthroughs in astronomythe study of objects or phenomena in space. One year later, in 1609, Galileo Galilei began the first studies of the solar system and the universe using a telescope. During the Renaissance era, Isaac Newton used observations made by Galileo to construct his three laws of motion. These laws were the standard for studying kinematics and dynamics even today.</para>

<para id="fs-id1164354602999">Another major branch of physics is <term class="no-emphasis">thermodynamics</term>, which includes the study of thermal energy and the transfer of heat. James Prescott Joule, an English physicist, studied the nature of heat and its relationship to work. Joule’s work helped lay the foundation for the first of three laws of thermodynamics that describe how energy in our universe is transferred from one object to another or transformed from one form to another. Studies in thermodynamics were motivated by the need to make engines more efficient, keep people safe from the elements, and preserve food.</para>

<para id="fs-id1164354472610">The 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries also saw great strides in the study of electricity and magnetism. <term class="no-emphasis">Electricity</term> involves the study of electric charges and their movements. <term class="no-emphasis">Magnetism</term> had long ago been noticed as an attractive force between a magnetized object and a metal like iron, or between the opposite poles (North and South) of two magnetized objects. In 1820, Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted showed that electric currents create magnetic fields. In 1831, English inventor Michael Faraday showed that moving a wire through a magnetic field could induce an electric current. These studies led to the inventions of the electric motor and electric generator, which revolutionized human life by bringing electricity and magnetism into our machines.</para><para id="fs-id1164354540028">The end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century saw the discovery of radioactive substances by the scientists Marie and Pierre Curie. <term class="no-emphasis">Nuclear physics</term> involves studying the nuclei of <term>atoms</term>, the source of nuclear radiation. In the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the study of nuclear physics eventually led to the ability to split the nucleus of an atom, a process called nuclear fission. This process is the basis for nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons. Also, the field of <term>quantum mechanics</term>, which involves the mechanics of atoms and molecules, saw great strides during the 20<sup>th</sup> century as our understanding of atoms and subatomic particles increased (see below).</para><para id="fs-id1164354528506">Early in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Albert Einstein revolutionized several branches of physics, especially relativity. Relativity revolutionized our understanding of motion and the universe in general as described further in this chapter. Now, in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, physicists continue to study these and many other branches of physics.</para>

<para id="fs-id1164354631526">By studying the most important topics in physics, you will gain analytical abilities that will enable you to apply physics far beyond the scope of what can be included in a single book.

<title>Physics: Past and Present</title>
<para id="fs-id1164354879006">The word physics is thought to come from the Greek word <emphasis effect="italics">phusis</emphasis>, meaning nature. The study of nature later came to be called <emphasis effect="italics">natural philosophy</emphasis>. From ancient times through the Renaissance, natural philosophy encompassed many fields, including astronomy, biology, chemistry, mathematics, and medicine. Over the last few centuries, the growth of scientific knowledge has resulted in ever-increasing specialization and branching of natural philosophy into separate fields, with physics retaining the most basic facets. Physics, as it developed from the Renaissance to the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, is called <term>classical physics</term>. Revolutionary discoveries starting at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century transformed physics from classical physics to <term>modern physics</term>.</para>

<para id="fs-id1164353401791">Classical physics is not an exact description of the universe, but it is an excellent approximation under the following conditions: (1) matter must be moving at speeds less than about 1 percent of the speed of light, (2) the objects dealt with must be large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and (3) only weak gravity, such as that generated by Earth, can be involved. Very small objects, such as atoms and molecules, cannot be adequately explained by classical physics. These three conditions apply to almost all of everyday experience. As a result, most aspects of classical physics should make sense on an intuitive level.</para>

Relate this to the approximately eight minute trip that light takes to travel 150 billion kilometers (93 billion miles) from the Sun to the Earth.</para></note>

<para id="fs-id1164354658284">Many laws of classical physics have been modified during the 20<sup>th</sup> century, resulting in revolutionary changes in technology, society, and our view of the universe. As a result, many aspects of modern physics, which occur outside of the range of our everyday experience, may seem bizarre or unbelievable. So why is most of this textbook devoted to classical physics? There are two main reasons. The first is that knowledge of classical physics is necessary to understand modern physics. The second reason is that classical physics still gives an accurate description of the universe under a wide range of everyday circumstances.</para>

<para id="fs-id1164353401992">Modern physics includes two revolutionary theories: relativity and quantum mechanics. These theories deal with the very fast and the very small, respectively. The <term>theory of relativity</term> was developed by Albert Einstein in 1905. By examining how two observers moving relative to each other would see the same phenomena, Einstein devised radical new ideas about time and space. He came to the startling conclusion that the measured length of an object travelling at high speeds (greater than about one percent of the speed of light) is shorter than the same object measured at rest. Perhaps even more bizarre is the idea the time for the same process to occur is different depending on the motion of the observer. Time passes more slowly for an object travelling at high speeds. A trip to the nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, might take an astronaut 4.5 Earth years if the ship travels near the speed of light. However, because time is slowed at higher speeds, the astronaut would age only 0.5 years during the trip. Einstein’s ideas of relativity were accepted after they were confirmed by numerous experiments.</para>

<para id="fs-id1164354538885">Gravity, the force that holds us to Earth, can also affect time and space. For example, time passes more slowly on Earth’s surface than for objects farther from the surface, such as a satellite in orbit. The very accurate clocks on global positioning satellites have to correct for this. They slowly keep getting ahead of clocks at Earth’s surface. This is called time dilation, and it occurs because gravity, in essence, slows down time.</para>

<para id="fs-id1164354949787"><span>[AL]</span>By saying that time passes more slowly at near-light speeds or high gravity, it is important to mention that people in both locations perceive the second as the same length of time.</para>
</note>

<para id="fs-id1164354495139">Large objects, like Earth, have strong enough gravity to distort space. To visualize this idea, think about a bowling ball placed on a trampoline. The bowling ball depresses or curves the surface of the trampoline. If you rolled a marble across the trampoline, it would follow the surface of the trampoline, roll into the depression caused by the bowling ball, and hit the ball. Similarly, the Earth curves space around it in the shape of a funnel. These curves in space due to the Earth cause objects to be attracted to Earth (i.e., gravity).</para>

<para id="fs-id1164354634189">Because of the way gravity affects space and time, Einstein stated that gravity affects the space-time continuum, as illustrated in <link target-id="Figure_01_01_Earth"/>. This is why time proceeds more slowly at Earth’s surface than in orbit. In black holes, whose gravity is hundreds of times that of Earth, time passes so slowly that it would appear to a far-away observer to have stopped!</para>

</media>

<caption>Einstein’s theory of relativity describes space and time as an interweaved mesh. Large objects, such as a planet, distort space, causing objects to fall in toward the planet due to the action of gravity. Large objects also distort time, causing time to proceed at a slower rate near the surface of Earth compared with the area outside of the distorted region of space-time.</caption></figure><note id="fs-id1164354471806" class="os-teacher">

</note>

<para id="fs-id1164354569346">In summary, relativity says that in describing the universe, it is important to realize that time, space and speed are not absolute. Instead, they can appear different to different observers. Einstein’s ability to reason out relativity is even more amazing because we cannot see the effects of relativity in our everyday lives.</para>

<para id="fs-id1164354678126">Quantum mechanics is the second major theory of modern physics. Quantum mechanics deals with the very small, namely, the subatomic particles that make up atoms. Atoms (<link target-id="Figure_01_01_gold"/>) are the smallest units of elements. However, atoms themselves are constructed of even smaller subatomic particles, such as protons, neutrons and electrons. Quantum mechanics strives to describe the properties and behavior of these and other subatomic particles. Often, these particles do not behave in the ways expected by classical physics. One reason for this is that they are small enough to travel at great speeds, near the speed of light.</para><figure id="Figure_01_01_gold"><media id="fs-id1164354600655" alt="An image of gold taken by a scanning tunneling microscope shows individual gold atoms.">

They can then study the properties of the particles at high speeds, as well as collide them with each other to see how they exchange energy. This has led to many intriguing discoveries such as the Higgs-Boson particle, which gives matter the property of mass, and antimatter, which causes a huge energy release when it comes in contact with matter.</para>

<para id="fs-id1164354555274">Physics is the foundation of many important scientific disciplines. For example, chemistry deals with the interactions of atoms and molecules. Not surprisingly, chemistry is rooted in atomic and molecular physics. Most branches of engineering are also applied physics. In architecture, physics is at the heart of determining structural stability, acoustics, heating, lighting, and cooling for buildings. Parts of geology, the study of nonliving parts of Earth, rely heavily on physics; including radioactive dating, earthquake analysis, and heat transfer across Earth’s surface. Indeed, some disciplines, such as biophysics and geophysics, are hybrids of physics and other disciplines.</para>

<title>The Physics of Landing on a Comet</title>
<para id="fs-id1164354555075">On November 12, 2014, the European Space Agency’s Rosetta spacecraft (shown in <link target-id="Figure_01_01_Rosetta"/>) became the first ever to reach and orbit a comet. Shortly after, Rosetta’s rover, Philae, landed on the comet, representing the first time humans have ever landed a space probe on a comet.</para><figure id="Figure_01_01_Rosetta"><media id="fs-id1164354626090" alt="An image of the Rosetta spacecraft is shown. It has large solar panels and is hovering over a comet.">

<caption>The Rosetta spacecraft, with its large and revolutionary solar panels, carried the Philae lander to a comet. The lander then detached and landed on the comet’s surface. (European Space Agency)</caption></figure><para id="fs-id1164354468641">After traveling 6.4 billion kilometers starting from its launch on Earth, Rosetta landed on the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which is only 4 kilometers wide. Physics was needed to successfully plot the course to reach such a small, distant, and rapidly moving target. Rosetta’s path to the comet was not straight forward. The probe first had to travel to Mars so that Mars’s gravity could accelerate it and divert it in the exact direction of the comet. </para><para id="fs-id1164354594416">This was not the first time humans used gravity to power our spaceships. Voyager 2, a space probe launched in 1977, used the gravity of Saturn to <emphasis effect="italics">slingshot</emphasis> over to Uranus and Neptune (illustrated in <link target-id="Figure_01_01_solar"/>), providing the first pictures ever taken of these planets. Now, almost 40 years after its launch, Voyager 2 is at the very edge of our solar system and is about to enter interstellar space. Its sister ship, Voyager 1 (illustrated in <link target-id="Figure_01_01_solar"/>), which was also launched in 1977, is already there.</para><para id="fs-id1164354871882">To listen to the sounds of interstellar space or see images that have been transmitted back from the Voyager I or to learn more about the Voyager mission, visit the <link url="https://openstax.org/l/28voyager">Voyager’s Mission website</link>.</para><figure id="Figure_01_01_solar"><media id="fs-id1164354656384" alt="Two diagrams are shown.

NASA b) A rendering of Voyager 1, the first space probe to ever leave our solar system and enter interstellar space. NASA</caption></figure><para id="fs-id1164354626383">Both Voyagers have electrical power generators based on the decay of radioisotopes. These generators have served them for almost 40 years. Rosetta, on the other hand, is solar-powered. In fact, Rosetta became the first space probe to travel beyond the asteroid belt by relying only on solar cells for power generation.</para>

<para id="fs-id1164353487283">At 800 million kilometers from the sun, Rosetta receives sunlight that is only 4 percent as strong as on Earth. In addition, it is very cold in space. Therefore, a lot of physics went into developing Rosetta’s low-intensity low-temperature solar cells.</para>

<para id="fs-id1164354501460">In this sense, the Rosetta project nicely shows the huge range of topics encompassed by physics: from modeling the movement of gigantic planets over huge distances within our solar systems, to learning how to generate electric power from low-intensity light. Physics is, by far, the broadest field of science.</para>

<para id="fs-id1164354633460">In summary, physics studies many of the most basic aspects of science. A knowledge of physics is, therefore, necessary to understand all other sciences. This is because physics explains the most basic ways in which our universe works. However, it is not necessary to formally study all applications of physics. A knowledge of the basic laws of physics will be most useful to you, so that you can use them to solve some everyday problems. In this way, the study of physics can improve your problem-solving skills.</para>
