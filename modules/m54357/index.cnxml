<para id="fs-id1167063659713">There are three ways, as shown in <link target-id="Figure_16_01_Ray"/>, in which light can travel from a source to another location. It can come directly from the source through empty space, such as from the Sun to Earth. Light can travel to an object through various media, such as air and glass. Light can also arrive at an object after being reflected, such as by a mirror. In all these cases, light is modeled as traveling in a straight line, called a <term><emphasis effect="italics">ray</emphasis></term>. Light may change direction when it encounters the surface of a different material (such as a mirror) or when it passes from one material to another (such as when passing from air into glass). It then continues in a straight line—that is, as a ray. The word <emphasis effect="italics">ray</emphasis> comes from mathematics. Here it means a straight line that originates from some point. It is acceptable to visualize light rays as laser rays (or even science fiction depictions of <emphasis effect="italics">ray guns</emphasis>).</para>

An arrow points from the Sun’s rays to a series of lines, which represent Earth’s atmosphere, directly above the Earth. In view (b), a woman is looking out of a window at her car. Arrows show the Sun’s rays bouncing off the car and traveling as light toward the woman.">

<caption>Three methods for light to travel from a source to another location are shown. (a) Light reaches the upper atmosphere of Earth by traveling through empty space directly from the source (the Sun). (b) This light can reach a person in one of two ways. It can travel through a medium, such as air or glass, and typically travels from one medium to another. It can also reflect from an object, such as a mirror.</caption>

<para id="fs-id1167066878429">Because light moves in straight lines, that is, as rays, and changes directions when it interacts with matter, it can be described through geometry and trigonometry. This part of optics, described by straight lines and angles, is therefore called <term><emphasis effect="italics">geometric optics</emphasis></term>. There are two laws that govern how light changes direction when it interacts with matter: the <term>law of reflection</term>, for situations in which light bounces off matter; and the <term>law of refraction</term>, for situations in which light passes through matter. In this section, we consider the geometric optics of <term>reflection</term>.</para>

Some colors of light may be absorbed and others reflected. Light often is partially absorbed and partially reflected. It may also be transmitted through a transparent material, such as water or glass. Typically, if the surface of a transparent material is smooth, such as that of a window pane, light is transmitted partially and reflected partially.</para>

<emphasis effect="italics">.</emphasis> This law governs the behavior of all waves when they interact with a smooth surface, and therefore describe the behavior of light waves as well. The reflection of light is simplified when light is treated as a ray. This concept is illustrated in <link target-id="Figure_16_01_Reflect"/>, which also shows how the angles are measured relative to the line perpendicular to the surface at the point where the light ray strikes it. This perpendicular line is also called the <emphasis effect="italics">normal line</emphasis>, or just the <emphasis effect="italics">normal</emphasis>. Light reflected in this way is referred to as <term>specular</term> (from the Latin word for <emphasis effect="italics">mirror</emphasis>: <emphasis effect="italics">speculum</emphasis>).</para>

<para id="fs-id1167067150525">We expect to see reflections from smooth surfaces, but <link target-id="Figure_16_01_Reflect2"/>, illustrates how a rough surface reflects light. Because the light is reflected from different parts of the surface at different angles, the rays go in many different directions, so the reflected light is <term>diffused</term>. Diffused light allows you to read a printed page from almost any angle because some of the rays go in different directions. Many objects, such as people, clothing, leaves, and walls, have rough surfaces and can be seen from many angles. A mirror, on the other hand, has a smooth surface and reflects light at specific angles.</para>
<figure id="Figure_16_01_Reflect"><media id="fs-id1167067107661" alt="A smooth, flat reflective surface is shown. A dotted line drops from the top of the figure and ends when it reaches the smooth surface. This line is perpendicular to the surface; there is a 90° angle between the surface and the perpendicular line. To the left of the perpendicular line, a ray (called an “incident ray” strikes the surface at a 45° angle. This ray—the “reflective ray”—is reflected off the surface to the right of the perpendicular line, again at a 45° angle. The angle between the incident ray and the perpendicular line is θi; the angle between the perpendicular line and the reflected ray is θr.">

<para id="fs-id1167066975516">When we see ourselves in a mirror, it appears that our image is actually behind the mirror. We see the light coming from a direction determined by the law of reflection. The angles are such that our image is exactly the same distance behind the mirror, <emphasis effect="italics">d</emphasis><sub>i</sub>, as the distance we stand away from the mirror, <emphasis effect="italics">d</emphasis><sub>o</sub>. Although these mirror images make objects appear to be where they cannot be (such as behind a solid wall), the images are not figments of our imagination. Mirror images can be photographed and videotaped by instruments and look just as they do to our eyes, which are themselves optical instruments. An image in a mirror is said to be a <term>virtual image</term>, as opposed to a <term>real image</term>. A virtual image is formed when light rays appear to diverge from a point without actually doing so.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167063751734"><link target-id="Figure_16_01_Flat_mirror"/> helps illustrate how a flat mirror forms an image. Two rays are shown emerging from the same point, striking the mirror, and reflecting into the observer’s eye. The rays can diverge slightly, and both still enter the eye. If the rays are extrapolated backward, they seem to originate from a common point behind the mirror, allowing us to locate the image. The paths of the reflected rays into the eye are the same as if they had come directly from that point behind the mirror. Using the law of reflection—the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence—we can see that the image and object are the same distance from the mirror. This is a virtual image, as defined earlier.</para>

This design uses a spherical primary concave mirror and a convex secondary mirror. The image is projected onto the focal plane by light passing through the perforated primary mirror. The effective focal length of such a telescope is the focal length of the primary mirror multiplied by the magnification of the secondary mirror.

You get the most concentrated thermal energy directly in front of the mirror and 3.00 m away from it. In general, this is not desirable because it could cause burns. Usually, you want the rays to emerge parallel, and this is accomplished by having the filament at the focal point of the mirror.</para>
