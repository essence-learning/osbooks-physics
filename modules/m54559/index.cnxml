<title>Revolutionary Properties of the Photoelectric Effect</title>
<para id="fs-id1167066051295">When Max Planck theorized that energy was quantized in a blackbody radiator, it is unlikely that he would have recognized just how revolutionary his idea was. Using tools similar to the light meter in <link target-id="Figure_21_02_LightMeter"/>, it would take a scientist of Albert <term class="no-emphasis">Einstein</term>’s stature to fully discover the implications of Max Planck’s radical concept.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065872521">Through careful observations of the photoelectric effect, Albert Einstein realized that there were several characteristics that could be explained only if <emphasis effect="italics">EM radiation is itself quantized</emphasis>. While these characteristics will be explained a bit later in this section, you can already begin to appreciate why Einstein’s idea is very important. It means that the apparently continuous stream of energy in an EM wave is actually not a continuous stream at all. In fact, the EM wave itself is actually composed of tiny quantum packets of energy called <term>photons</term>.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167065857871">It is important for students to be comfortable with the material to this point before moving forward. To ensure that they are, one task that you may have them do is to draw a few pictures similar to <link target-id="Figure_21_02_Flashlight"/>. Have the students draw photons leaving a low intensity flashlight vs. a high intensity flashlight, a high frequency flashlight vs. a low frequency flashlight, and a high wavelength flashlight vs. a low wavelength flashlight. These diagrams will help ensure the students understand fundamental concepts before moving to the difficult proofs that follow.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167066113489">Just as with Planck’s blackbody radiation, Einstein’s concept of the photon could take hold in the scientific community only if it could succeed where classical physics failed. The photoelectric effect would be a key to demonstrating Einstein’s brilliance.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167064817841">Consider the following five properties of the photoelectric effect. All of these properties are consistent with the idea that individual photons of EM radiation are absorbed by individual electrons in a material, with the electron gaining the photon’s energy. Some of these properties are inconsistent with the idea that EM radiation is a simple wave. For simplicity, let us consider what happens with monochromatic EM radiation in which all photons have the same energy <emphasis effect="italics">hf</emphasis>.</para>

<media id="fs-id1167066086108" alt="Four arrows representing ‘incoming radiation’ are shown striking a metal surface full of negative electrons.

<caption>Incident radiation strikes a clean metal surface, ejecting multiple electrons from it. The manner in which the frequency and intensity of the incoming radiation affect the ejected electrons strongly suggests that electromagnetic radiation is quantized. This event, called the photoelectric effect, is strong evidence for the existence of photons.</caption></figure>

<list id="fs-id1167065947633" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic">
<item>If we vary the frequency of the EM radiation falling on a clean metal surface, we find the following: For a given material, there is a threshold frequency <emphasis effect="italics">f</emphasis><sub>0</sub> for the EM radiation below which no electrons are ejected, regardless of intensity. Using the photon model, the explanation for this is clear. Individual photons interact with individual electrons. Thus if the energy of an individual photon is too low to break an electron away, no electrons will be ejected. However, if EM radiation were a simple wave, sufficient energy could be obtained simply by increasing the intensity.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="italics">Once EM radiation falls on a material, electrons are ejected without delay</emphasis>. As soon as an individual photon of sufficiently high frequency is absorbed by an individual electron, the electron is ejected. If the EM radiation were a simple wave, several minutes would be required for sufficient energy to be deposited at the metal surface in order to eject an electron.</item>
<item>The number of electrons ejected per unit time is proportional to the intensity of the EM radiation and to no other characteristic. High-intensity EM radiation consists of large numbers of photons per unit area, with all photons having the same characteristic energy, <emphasis effect="italics">hf</emphasis>. The increased number of photons per unit area results in an increased number of electrons per unit area ejected.</item>
<item>If we vary the intensity of the EM radiation and measure the energy of ejected electrons, we find the following: <emphasis effect="italics">The maximum kinetic energy of ejected electrons is independent of the intensity of the EM radiation</emphasis>. Instead, as noted in point 3 above, increased intensity results in more electrons of the same energy being ejected. If EM radiation were a simple wave, a higher intensity could transfer more energy, and higher-energy electrons would be ejected.</item>
<item>The kinetic energy KE of an ejected electron equals the photon energy minus the <term class="no-emphasis">binding energy</term> BE of the electron in the specific material. An individual photon can give all of its energy to an electron. The photon’s energy is partly used to break the electron away from the material. The remainder goes into the ejected electron’s kinetic energy. In equation form, this is given by</item>

<title>Discussion</title>
<para id="fs-id1167064930352">The energy of this 420 nm photon of violet light is a tiny fraction of a joule, and so it is no wonder that a single photon would be difficult for us to sense directly—humans are more attuned to energies on the order of joules. But looking at the energy in electron volts, we can see that this photon has enough energy to affect atoms and molecules. A DNA molecule can be broken with about 1 eV of energy, for example, and typical atomic and molecular energies are on the order of eV, so that the photon in this example could have biological effects, such as sunburn. The ejected electron has rather low energy, and it would not travel far, except in a vacuum. The electron would be stopped by a retarding potential of only 0.26 eV, a slightly larger KE than calculated above. In fact, if the photon wavelength were longer and its energy less than 2.71 eV, then the formula would give a negative kinetic energy, an impossibility. This simply means that the 420 nm photons with their 2.96 eV energy are not much above the frequency threshold. You can see for yourself that the threshold wavelength is 458 nm (blue light). This means that if calcium metal were used in a light meter, the meter would be insensitive to wavelengths longer than those of blue light. Such a light meter would be completely insensitive to red light, for example.</para>

<title>Technological Applications of the Photoelectric Effect</title>
<para id="fs-id1167065974562">While Einstein’s understanding of the photoelectric effect was a transformative discovery in the early 1900s, its presence is ubiquitous today. If you have watched streetlights turn on automatically in response to the setting sun, stopped elevator doors from closing simply by putting your hands between them, or turned on a water faucet by sliding your hands near it, you are familiar with the <term>electric eye</term>, a name given to a group of devices that use the photoelectric effect for detection.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065872186">All these devices rely on photoconductive cells. These cells are activated when light is absorbed by a semi-conductive material, knocking off a free electron. When this happens, an electron void is left behind, which attracts a nearby electron. The movement of this electron, and the resultant chain of electron movements, produces a current. If electron ejection continues, further holes are created, thereby increasing the electrical conductivity of the cell. This current can turn switches on and off and activate various familiar mechanisms.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167066136930">One such mechanism takes place where you may not expect it. Next time you are at the movie theater, pay close attention to the sound coming out of the speakers. This sound is actually created using the photoelectric effect! The audiotape in the projector booth is a transparent piece of film of varying width. This film is fed between a photocell and a bright light produced by an exciter lamp. As the transparent portion of the film varies in width, the amount of light that strikes the photocell varies as well. As a result, the current in the photoconductive circuit changes with the width of the filmstrip. This changing current is converted to a changing frequency, which creates the soundtrack commonly heard in the theater.</para>
<note id="fs-id1167066121148" class="work-in-physics"><title>Solar Energy Physicist</title>

<para id="fs-id1167062355242">According to the U.S. Department of Energy, Earth receives enough sunlight each hour to power the entire globe for a year. While converting all of this energy is impossible, the job of the solar energy physicist is to explore and improve upon solar energy conversion technologies so that we may harness more of this abundant resource.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167066046747">The field of solar energy is not a new one. For over half a century, satellites and spacecraft have utilized <term class="no-emphasis">photovoltaic cells</term> to create current and power their operations. As time has gone on, scientists have worked to adapt this process so that it may be used in homes, businesses, and full-scale power stations using solar cells like the one shown in <link target-id="Figure_21_02_Photocell"/>.</para>

<figure id="Figure_21_02_Photocell">
<media id="fs-id1167063629171" alt="There is an image of a blue solar cell. The solar cell is square, with diagonal notches removed from each corner.">
<image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/CNX_HSPhysics_21_02_Photocell.jpg"/>
</media>
<caption>A solar cell is an example of a photovoltaic cell. As light strikes the cell, the cell absorbs the energy of the photons. If this energy exceeds the binding energy of the electrons, then electrons will be forced to move in the cell, thereby producing a current. This current may be used for a variety of purposes. (credit: U.S. Department of Energy)</caption></figure>
<para id="fs-id1167066103554">Solar energy is converted to electrical energy in one of two manners: direct transfer through photovoltaic cells or thermal conversion through the use of a CSP, concentrating solar power, system. Unlike electric eyes, which trip a mechanism when current is lost, photovoltaic cells utilize semiconductors to directly transfer the electrons released through the photoelectric effect into a directed current. The energy from this current can then be converted for storage, or immediately used in an electric process. A CSP system is an indirect method of energy conversion. In this process, light from the Sun is channeled using parabolic mirrors. The light from these mirrors strikes a thermally conductive material, which then heats a pool of water. This water, in turn, is converted to steam, which turns a turbine and creates electricity. While indirect, this method has long been the traditional means of large-scale power generation.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065067419">There are, of course, limitations to the efficacy of solar power. Cloud cover, nightfall, and incident angle strike at high altitudes are all factors that directly influence the amount of light energy available. Additionally, the creation of photovoltaic cells requires rare-earth minerals that can be difficult to obtain. However, the major role of a solar energy physicist is to find ways to improve the efficiency of the solar energy conversion process. Currently, this is done by experimenting with new semi conductive materials, by refining current energy transfer methods, and by determining new ways of incorporating solar structures into the current power grid.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065067422">Additionally, many solar physicists are looking into ways to allow for increased solar use in impoverished, more remote locations. Because solar energy conversion does not require a connection to a large-scale power grid, research into thinner, more mobile materials will permit remote cultures to use solar cells to convert sunlight collected during the day into stored energy that can then be used at night.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065809905">Regardless of the application, solar energy physicists are an important part of the future in responsible energy growth. While a doctoral degree is often necessary for advanced research applications, a bachelor's or master's degree in a related science or engineering field is typically enough to gain access into the industry. Computer skills are very important for energy modeling, including knowledge of CAD software for design purposes. In addition, the ability to collaborate and communicate with others is critical to becoming a solar energy physicist.</para>
