<title>Resonance and Beats</title>
<para id="fs-id1167062325840">Sit in front of a piano sometime and sing a loud brief note at it while pushing down on the sustain pedal. It will sing the same note back at you—the strings that have the same frequencies as your voice, are resonating in response to the forces from the sound waves that you sent to them. This is a good example of the fact that objects—in this case, piano strings—can be forced to oscillate but oscillate best at their natural frequency. </para>
<para id="fs-id1167065826634">A driving force (such as your voice in the example) puts energy into a system at a certain frequency, which is not necessarily the same as the natural frequency of the system. Over time the energy dissipates, and the amplitude gradually reduces to zero- this is called <term>damping</term>. The <term>natural frequency</term> is the frequency at which a system would oscillate if there were no driving and no damping force. The phenomenon of driving a system with a frequency equal to its natural frequency is called <term>resonance</term>, and a system being driven at its natural frequency is said to <term>resonate</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167064696613">Most of us have played with toys where an object bobs up and down on an elastic band, something like the paddle ball suspended from a finger in <link target-id="Figure_14_04_Finger"/>. At first you hold your finger steady, and the ball bounces up and down with a small amount of damping. If you move your finger up and down slowly, the ball will follow along without bouncing much on its own. As you increase the frequency at which you move your finger up and down, the ball will respond by oscillating with increasing amplitude. When you drive the ball at its natural frequency, the ball’s oscillations increase in amplitude with each oscillation for as long as you drive it. As the driving frequency gets progressively higher than the resonant or natural frequency, the amplitude of the oscillations becomes smaller, until the oscillations nearly disappear and your finger simply moves up and down with little effect on the ball.</para>

<figure id="Figure_14_04_Finger">
<media id="fs-id1167065049539" alt="A ball bobs up and down with the greatest amplitude when the finger drives its oscillation at the fundamental frequency.">
<image mime-type="image/jpeg" src="../../media/CNX_HSPhysics_14_04_Finger.jpg"/></media>
<caption>The paddle ball on its rubber band moves in response to the finger supporting it. If the finger moves with the natural frequency of the ball on the rubber band, then a resonance is achieved, and the amplitude of the ball’s oscillations increases dramatically. At higher and lower driving frequencies, energy is transferred to the ball less efficiently, and it responds with lower-amplitude oscillations.</caption>
</figure>

<para id="fs-id1167064563304">Another example is that when you tune a radio, you adjust its resonant frequency so that it oscillates only at the desired station’s broadcast (driving) frequency. Also, a child on a swing is driven (pushed) by a parent at the swing’s natural frequency to reach the maximum amplitude (height). In all of these cases, the efficiency of energy transfer from the driving force into the oscillator is best at resonance.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167065980149"><span>[BL]</span><span>[OL]</span><span>[AL]</span> Tuning forks and pipes may be used to demonstrate the concept of resonance. Use any pipe or tube closed at one end. Fix it so that it stands upright with the open end on top. Choose a tuning fork and strike it to make it vibrate. Place it near the mouth of the pipe and hear the sound. Now fill the pipe with some water and repeat. The changing water level changes the length of the resonating air column. Continue doing this. When a certain length is obtained, the sound of the tuning fork will resonate through the column.</para>
</note>

<para id="fs-id1167066145854">All sound resonances are due to constructive and destructive interference. Only the resonant frequencies interfere constructively to form standing waves, while others interfere destructively and are absent. From the toot made by blowing over a bottle to the recognizability of a great singer’s voice, resonance and standing waves play a vital role in sound.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167062814219">Interference happens to all types of waves, including sound waves. In fact, one way to support that something <emphasis effect="italics">is a wave</emphasis> is to observe interference effects. <link target-id="Figure_14_04_Cancel"/> shows a set of headphones that employs a clever use of sound interference to cancel noise. To get destructive interference, a fast electronic analysis is performed, and a second sound is introduced with its maxima and minima exactly reversed from the incoming noise.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167064879322">In addition to resonance, superposition of waves can also create beats. <term>Beats</term> are produced by the superposition of two waves with slightly different frequencies but the same amplitude. The waves alternate in time between constructive interference and destructive interference, giving the resultant wave an amplitude that varies over time.

<title>Fundamental Frequency and Harmonics</title>
<para id="fs-id1167062348188">Suppose we hold a tuning fork near the end of a tube that is closed at the other end, as shown in <link target-id="Figure_14_04_Resonance"/>, <link target-id="Figure_14_04_Resonance1"/>, and <link target-id="Figure_14_04_Resonance2"/>. If the tuning fork has just the right frequency, the air column in the tube resonates loudly, but at most frequencies it vibrates very little. This means that the air column has only certain natural frequencies. The figures show how a resonance at the lowest of these natural frequencies is formed. A disturbance travels down the tube at the speed of sound and bounces off the closed end. If the tube is just the right length, the reflected sound arrives back at the tuning fork exactly half a cycle later, and it interferes constructively with the continuing sound produced by the tuning fork. The incoming and reflected sounds form a standing wave in the tube as shown.</para>

For example, the note middle C on a trumpet sounds very different from middle C on a clarinet, even though both instruments are basically modified versions of a tube closed at one end. The fundamental frequency is the same (and usually the most intense), but the overtones and their mix of intensities are different. This mix is what gives musical instruments (and human voices) their distinctive characteristics, whether they have air columns, strings, or drumheads. In fact, much of our speech is determined by shaping the cavity formed by the throat and mouth and positioning the tongue to adjust the fundamental and combination of overtones.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167062588012"><span>[BL]</span><span>[OL]</span><span>[AL]</span> Other instruments also use air resonance in different ways to amplify sound. For instance, a violin and a guitar both have sounding boxes but with different shapes, resulting in different overtone structures. The vibrating string creates a sound that resonates in the sounding box, greatly amplifying the sound and creating overtones that give the instrument its characteristic flavor. The more complex the shape of the sounding box, the greater its ability to resonate over a wide range of frequencies. The type and thickness of wood or other materials used to make the sounding box also affects the quality of sound. Ask students to give more examples of how different musical instruments use the phenomenon of resonance.</para>

Choose a piece of bamboo for creating a musical pipe. Calculate the length required for a certain frequency to resonate and then mark the locations where holes should be placed in the pipe to achieve their desired pitches. Use a simple hand drill or ask your wood shop department for help drilling holes. Use tuning forks to test and calibrate your instrument. Demonstrate your pipe for the class.</para></problem>
