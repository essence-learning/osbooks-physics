Gases are especially affected by thermal expansion, although liquids expand to a lesser extent with similar increases in temperature, and even solids have minor expansions at higher temperatures. This is why railroad tracks and bridges have expansion joints that allow them to freely expand and contract with temperature changes.</para>

Real gases differ from these in certain ways. For instance, it is assumed that in an ideal gas, there are no intermolecular forces, all collisions between molecules are perfectly elastic, and so on. However, the ideal gas law is useful in calculations, because under standard conditions of temperature and pressure, many real gases, such as oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and noble gases exhibit qualitative behavior that is very close to the behavior of an ideal gas.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167066205403">To get some idea of how pressure, temperature, and volume of a gas are related to one another, consider what happens when you pump air into a deflated tire. The tire’s volume first increases in direct proportion to the amount of air injected, without much increase in the tire pressure. Once the tire has expanded to nearly its full size, the walls limit volume expansion. If you continue to pump air into tire (which now has a nearly constant volume), the pressure increases with increasing temperature (see <link target-id="Figure_12_02_TirePressure"/>).</para>

</note>
<para id="fs-id1167064649082">Heat (<emphasis effect="italics">Q</emphasis>) and work (<emphasis effect="italics">W</emphasis>) are the two ways to add or remove energy from a system. The processes are very different. Heat is driven by temperature differences, while work involves a force exerted through a distance. Nevertheless, heat and work can produce identical results. For example, both can cause a temperature increase. Heat transfers energy into a system, such as when the sun warms the air in a bicycle tire and increases the air’s temperature. Similarly, work can be done on the system, as when the bicyclist pumps air into the tire. Once the temperature increase has occurred, it is impossible to tell whether it was caused by heat or work. Heat and work are both energy in transit—neither is stored as such in a system. However, both can change the internal energy, <emphasis effect="italics">U</emphasis>, of a system.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065715361"><term>Internal energy</term> is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of a system’s atoms and molecules. It can be divided into many subcategories, such as thermal and chemical energy, and depends only on the state of a system (that is, <emphasis effect="italics">P</emphasis>,<emphasis effect="italics"> V</emphasis>, and <emphasis effect="italics">T</emphasis>), not on how the energy enters or leaves the system.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065859858">In order to understand the relationship between heat, work, and internal energy, we use the <term>first law of thermodynamics</term>.

<para id="fs-id1167065951248">We often think about thermodynamics as being useful for inventing or testing machinery, such as engines or steam turbines. However, thermodynamics also applies to living systems, such as our own bodies. This forms the basis of the biological thermodynamics (<link target-id="Figure_12_02_FoodEnergy"/>).</para>

<figure id="Figure_12_02_FoodEnergy"><media id="fs-id1167062979109" alt="A man takes in energy from food, gives off heat, and does work in part (a). A flower absorbs heat from the Sun and gives off heat in part (b).">

</media>
<caption>(a) The first law of thermodynamics applies to metabolism. Heat transferred out of the body (Q) and work done by the body (W) remove internal energy, whereas food intake replaces it. (Food intake may be considered work done on the body.) (b) Plants convert part of the radiant energy in sunlight into stored chemical energy, a process called <emphasis effect="italics">photosynthesis</emphasis>.</caption></figure>

<para id="fs-id1167065679746">Life itself depends on the biological transfer of energy. Through photosynthesis, plants absorb solar energy from the sun and use this energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Photosynthesis takes in one form of energy—light—and converts it into another form—chemical potential energy (glucose and other carbohydrates).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167062967276"><emphasis effect="italics">Human metabolism</emphasis> is the conversion of food into energy given off by heat, work done by the body’s cells, and stored fat. Metabolism is an interesting example of the first law of thermodynamics in action. Eating increases the internal energy of the body by adding chemical potential energy; this is an unromantic view of a good burrito.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065787738">The body metabolizes all the food we consume. Basically, metabolism is an oxidation process in which the chemical potential energy of food is released. This implies that food input is in the form of work. Exercise helps you lose weight, because it provides energy transfer from your body by both heat and work and raises your metabolic rate even when you are at rest.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167064794426">Biological thermodynamics also involves the study of transductions between cells and living organisms. <emphasis effect="italics">Transduction</emphasis> is a process where genetic material—DNA—is transferred from one cell to another. This often occurs during a viral infection (e.g., influenza) and is how the virus spreads, namely, by transferring its genetic material to an increasing number of previously healthy cells. Once enough cells become infected, you begin to feel the effects of the virus (flu symptoms—muscle weakness, coughing, and congestion).</para>
<para id="fs-id1167064775137">Energy is transferred along with the genetic material and so obeys the first law of thermodynamics. Energy is transferred—not created or destroyed—in the process. When work is done on a cell or heat transfers energy to a cell, the cell’s internal energy increases. When a cell does work or loses heat, its internal energy decreases. If the amount of work done by a cell is the same as the amount of energy transferred in by heat, or the amount of work performed on a cell matches the amount of energy transferred out by heat, there will be no net change in internal energy.</para>
