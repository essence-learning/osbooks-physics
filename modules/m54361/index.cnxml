<para id="fs-id1167065858906">Lenses are found in a huge array of optical instruments, ranging from a simple magnifying glass to the eye to a camera’s zoom lens. In this section, we use the law of refraction to explore the properties of lenses and how they form images.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065943153">Some of what we learned in the earlier discussion of curved mirrors also applies to the study of lenses. Concave, convex, focal point F, and focal length <emphasis effect="italics">f</emphasis> have the same meanings as before, except each measurement is made from the center of the lens instead of the surface of the mirror. The <term>convex lens</term> shown in <link target-id="Figure_16_03_ConvexLens"/> has been shaped so that all light rays that enter it parallel to its central axis cross one another at a single point on the opposite side of the lens. The central axis, or axis, is defined to be a line normal to the lens at its center. Such a lens is called a <term>converging lens</term> because of the converging effect it has on light rays. An expanded view of the path of one ray through the lens is shown in <link target-id="Figure_16_03_ConvexLens"/> to illustrate how the ray changes direction both as it enters and as it leaves the lens. Because the index of refraction of the lens is greater than that of air, the ray moves toward the perpendicular as it enters and away from the perpendicular as it leaves. (This is in accordance with the law of refraction.) As a result of the shape of the lens, light is thus bent toward the axis at both surfaces.</para>
<figure id="Figure_16_03_ConvexLens"><media id="fs-id1167065809698" alt="A drawing on the left side of the figure depicts a convex lens with three parallel light rays (labeled 1, 2, and 3 from top to bottom) passing through the lens from the left and converging to the right of the lens at F. After passing through F, the light rays are flipped from top to bottom (3, 2, 1). The figure on the right is an expanded view of the figure on the left.">

<caption>Rays of light entering a convex, or converging, lens parallel to its axis converge at its focal point, F. Ray 2 lies on the axis of the lens. The distance from the center of the lens to the focal point is the focal length, <emphasis effect="italics">ƒ</emphasis>, of the lens. An expanded view of the path taken by ray 1 shows the perpendiculars and the angles of incidence and refraction at both surfaces.</caption>
</figure>
<para id="fs-id1167064984875">Note that rays from a light source placed at the focal point of a converging lens emerge parallel from the other side of the lens. You may have heard of the trick of using a converging lens to focus rays of sunlight to a point. Such a concentration of light energy can produce enough heat to ignite paper.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167064894736"><link target-id="Figure_16_03_Concave_Lens"/> shows a <term>concave lens</term> and the effect it has on rays of light that enter it parallel to its axis (the path taken by ray 2 in the figure is the axis of the lens). The concave lens is a <term>diverging lens</term> because it causes the light rays to bend away (diverge) from its axis. In this case, the lens has been shaped so all light rays entering it parallel to its axis appear to originate from the same point, F, defined to be the focal point of a diverging lens. The distance from the center of the lens to the focal point is again called the <emphasis effect="italics">focal length</emphasis>, or “<emphasis effect="italics">ƒ</emphasis>,” of the lens. Note that the focal length of a diverging lens is defined to be negative. An expanded view of the path of one ray through the lens is shown in <link target-id="Figure_16_03_Concave_Lens"/> to illustrate how the shape of the lens, together with the law of refraction, causes the ray to follow its particular path and diverge.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167065954769">The power, <emphasis effect="italics">P</emphasis>, of a lens is very easy to calculate. It is simply the reciprocal of the focal length, expressed in meters</para>

It is possible to calculate the location of the focal point using the law of refraction (Snell’s law) and the refractive index of the lens material, but this process is time-consuming and difficult to do accurately.

<para id="fs-id1167065738903">In some circumstances, a lens forms an image at an obvious location, such as when a movie projector casts an image onto a screen. In other cases, the image location is less obvious. Where, for example, is the image formed by eyeglasses? We use ray tracing for thin lenses to illustrate how they form images, and we develop equations to describe the image-formation quantitatively. These are the rules for ray tracing:</para>
<list id="fs-id1167064875149" list-type="enumerated">
<item>A ray entering a converging lens parallel to its axis passes through the focal point, F, of the lens on the other side</item>
<item>A ray entering a diverging lens parallel to its axis seems to come from the focal point, F, on the side of the entering ray</item>
<item>A ray passing through the center of either a converging or a diverging lens does not change direction</item>
<item>A ray entering a converging lens through its focal point exits parallel to its axis</item>
<item>A ray that enters a diverging lens by heading toward the focal point on the opposite side exits parallel to the axis</item>
</list>

<para id="fs-id1167065892046">Consider an object some distance away from a converging lens, as shown in <link target-id="Figure_16_03_ConvexL2"/>. To find the location and size of the image formed, we trace the paths of select light rays originating from one point on the object. In this example, the originating point is the top of a woman’s head. <link target-id="Figure_16_03_ConvexL2"/> shows three rays from the top of the object that can be traced using the ray-tracing rules just listed. Rays leave this point traveling in many directions, but we concentrate on only a few, which have paths that are easy to trace. The first ray is one that enters the lens parallel to its axis and passes through the focal point on the other side (rule 1). The second ray passes through the center of the lens without changing direction (rule 3). The third ray passes through the nearer focal point on its way into the lens and leaves the lens parallel to its axis (rule 4). All rays that come from the same point on the top of the person’s head are refracted in such a way as to cross at the same point on the other side of the lens. The image of the top of the person’s head is located at this point. Rays from another point on the object, such as the belt buckle, also cross at another common point, forming a complete image, as shown. Although three rays are traced in <link target-id="Figure_16_03_ConvexL2"/>, only two are necessary to locate the image. It is best to trace rays for which there are simple ray-tracing rules. Before applying ray tracing to other situations, let us consider the example shown in <link target-id="Figure_16_03_ConvexL2"/> in more detail.</para>
<figure id="Figure_16_03_ConvexL2">
<media id="fs-id1167064549938" alt="This series of drawings shows a woman standing to the left of a lens. Rays originate from the top of her head and pass through the lens at various angles to create a real image on the other side of the lens.">

<caption>Ray tracing is used to locate the image formed by a lens. Rays originating from the same point on the object are traced. The three chosen rays each follow one of the rules for ray tracing, so their paths are easy to determine. The image is located at the point where the rays cross. In this case, a real image—one that can be projected on a screen—is formed.</caption>

<para id="fs-id1167066037149">The image formed in <link target-id="Figure_16_03_ConvexL2"/> is a real image—meaning, it can be projected. That is, light rays from one point on the object actually cross at the location of the image and can be projected onto a screen, a piece of film, or the retina of an eye.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167065871537">In <link target-id="Figure_16_03_ConvexL2"/>, the object distance, <emphasis effect="italics">d<sub>o</sub></emphasis>, is greater than <emphasis effect="italics">f.</emphasis> Now we consider a ray diagram for a convex lens where <emphasis effect="italics">d<sub>o</sub>&lt;</emphasis> <emphasis effect="italics">f</emphasis>, and another diagram for a concave lens.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167062811451"><link target-id="Figure_16_03_Microscope"/> shows the path of light through a typical microscope. Microscopes were first developed during the early 1600s by eyeglass makers in the Netherlands and Denmark. The simplest compound microscope is constructed from two convex lenses, as shown schematically in <link target-id="Figure_16_03_Microscope"/>. The first lens is called the <emphasis effect="italics">objective lens</emphasis>; it has typical magnification values from 5 <m:math>
 <m:mo>×</m:mo>
</m:math>  to 100 <m:math>
 <m:mo>×</m:mo>
</m:math> . In standard microscopes, the <term>objectives</term> are mounted such that when you switch between them, the sample remains in focus. Objectives arranged in this way are described as <term><emphasis effect="italics">parfocal</emphasis></term>. The second lens, the <term>eyepiece</term>, also referred to as the <term><emphasis effect="italics">ocular</emphasis></term>, has several lenses that slide inside a cylindrical barrel. The focusing ability is provided by the movement of both the objective lens and the eyepiece. The purpose of a microscope is to magnify small objects, and both lenses contribute to the final magnification. In addition, the final enlarged image is produced in a location far enough from the observer to be viewed easily because the eye cannot focus on objects or images that are too close.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167066054949">Real lenses behave somewhat differently from how they are modeled using rays diagrams or the thin-lens equations. Real lenses produce aberrations. An <term>aberration</term> is a distortion in an image. There are a variety of aberrations that result from lens size, material, thickness, and the position of the object. One common type of aberration is <term>chromatic aberration</term>, which is related to color. Because the index of refraction of lenses depends on color, or wavelength, images are produced at different places and with different magnifications for different colors. The law of reflection is independent of wavelength, so mirrors do not have this problem. This result is another advantage for the use of mirrors in optical systems such as telescopes.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167064546032"><link target-id="Figure_16_03_Aberration"/>(a) shows chromatic aberration for a single convex lens, and its partial correction with a two-lens system. The index of refraction of the lens increases with decreasing wavelength, so violet rays are refracted more than red rays, and are thus focused closer to the lens. The diverging lens corrects this in part, although it is usually not possible to do so completely. Lenses made of different materials and with different dispersions may be used. For example, an achromatic doublet consisting of a converging lens made of crown glass in contact with a diverging lens made of flint glass can reduce chromatic aberration dramatically (<link target-id="Figure_16_03_Aberration"/>(b)).</para>

<caption>(a) Chromatic aberration is caused by the dependence of a lens’s index of refraction on color (wavelength). The lens is more powerful for violet (V) than for red (R), producing images with different colors, locations, and magnifications. (b) Multiple-lens systems can correct chromatic aberrations in part, but they may require lenses of different materials and add to the expense of optical systems such as cameras.</caption>

<para id="fs-id1167063429677">The eye is perhaps the most interesting of all optical instruments. It is remarkable in how it forms images and in the richness of detail and color they eye can detect. However, our eyes commonly need some correction to reach what is called <emphasis effect="italics">normal</emphasis> vision, but should be called <emphasis effect="italics">ideal</emphasis> vision instead. Image formation by our eyes and common vision correction are easy to analyze using geometric optics. <link target-id="Figure_16_03_Eye"/> shows the basic anatomy of the eye. The cornea and lens form a system that, to a good approximation, acts as a single thin lens. For clear vision, a real image must be projected onto the light-sensitive retina, which lies at a fixed distance from the lens. The lens of the eye adjusts its power to produce an image on the retina for objects at different distances. The center of the image falls on the fovea, which has the greatest density of light receptors and the greatest acuity (sharpness) in the visual field. There are no receptors at the place where the optic nerve meets the eye, which is called the <emphasis effect="italics">blind spot</emphasis>. An image falling on this spot cannot be seen. The variable opening (or pupil) of the eye along with chemical adaptation allows the eye to detect light intensities from the lowest observable to 10<sup>10</sup> times greater (without damage). Ten orders of magnitude is an incredible range of detection. Our eyes perform a vast number of functions, such as sense direction, movement, sophisticated colors, and distance. Processing of visual nerve impulses begins with interconnections in the retina and continues in the brain. The optic nerve conveys signals received by the eye to the brain.</para>

<caption>The cornea and lens of an eye act together to form a real image on the light-sensing retina, which has its densest concentration of receptors in the fovea, and a blind spot over the optic nerve. The power of the lens of an eye is adjustable to provide an image on the retina for varying object distances.</caption>
</figure>

<para id="fs-id1167066946736">Refractive indices are crucial to image formation using lenses. <link target-id="Table_16_04"/> shows refractive indices relevant to the eye. The biggest change in the refractive index—and the one that causes the greatest bending of rays—occurs at the cornea rather than the lens. The ray diagram in <link target-id="Figure_16_03_Eye2"/> shows image formation by the cornea and lens of the eye. The rays bend according to the refractive indices provided in <link target-id="Table_16_04"/>. The cornea provides about two-thirds of the magnification of the eye because the speed of light changes considerably while traveling from air into the cornea. The lens provides the remaining magnification needed to produce an image on the retina. The cornea and lens can be treated as a single thin lens, although the light rays pass through several layers of material (such as the cornea, aqueous humor, several layers in the lens, and vitreous humor), changing direction at each interface. The image formed is much like the one produced by a single convex lens. This result is a case 1 image. Images formed in the eye are inverted, but the brain inverts them once more to make them seem upright.</para>

<caption>An image is formed on the retina, with light rays converging most at the cornea and on entering and exiting the lens. Rays from the top and bottom of the object are traced and produce an inverted real image on the retina. The distance to the object is drawn smaller than scale.</caption>
</figure>

<para id="fs-id1167061250456">As noted, the image must fall precisely on the retina to produce clear vision—that is, the image distance, <emphasis effect="italics">d</emphasis><sub>i</sub>, must equal the lens-to-retina distance. Because the lens-to-retina distance does not change, <emphasis effect="italics">d</emphasis><sub>i</sub> must be the same for objects at all distances. The eye manages to vary the distance by varying the power (and focal length) of the lens to accommodate for objects at various distances. In <link target-id="Figure_16_03_Eye2"/>, you can see the small ciliary muscles above and below the lens that change the shape of the lens and, thus, the focal length.</para>
<para id="fs-id1167061226385">The need for some type of vision correction is very common. Common vision defects are easy to understand, and some are simple to correct. <link target-id="Figure_16_03_Eye3"/> illustrates two common vision defects. Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the inability to see distant objects clearly while close objects are in focus. The nearsighted eye <emphasis effect="italics">overconverges</emphasis> the nearly parallel rays from a distant object, and the rays cross in front of the retina. More divergent rays from a close object are converged on the retina, producing a clear image. Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the inability to see close objects clearly whereas distant objects may be in focus. A farsighted eye does not converge rays from a close object sufficiently to make the rays meet on the retina. Less divergent rays from a distant object can be converged for a clear image.</para>

<caption>(a) The nearsighted (myopic) eye converges rays from a distant object in front of the retina; thus, they are diverging when they strike the retina, and produce a blurry image. This divergence can be caused by the lens of the eye being too powerful (in other words, too short a focal length) or the length of the eye being too great. (b) The farsighted (hyperopic) eye is unable to converge the rays from a close object by the time they strike the retina and produce ... blurry close vision. This poor convergence can be caused by insufficient power (in other words, too long a focal length) in the lens or by the eye being too short.</caption>
</figure>

<para id="fs-id1167066991166">Because the nearsighted eye overconverges light rays, the correction for nearsightedness involves placing a diverging spectacle lens in front of the eye. This lens reduces the power of an eye that has too short a focal length (<link target-id="Figure_16_05_Eye4"/>(a)). Because the farsighted eye <emphasis effect="italics">underconverges</emphasis> light rays, the correction for farsightedness is to place a converging spectacle lens in front of the eye. This lens increases the power of an eye that has too long a focal length (<link target-id="Figure_16_05_Eye4"/>(b)).</para>

<caption>(a) Correction of nearsightedness requires a diverging lens that compensates for the overconvergence by the eye. The diverging lens produces an image closer to the eye than the object so that the nearsighted person can see it clearly. (b) Correction of farsightedness uses a converging lens that compensates for the underconvergence by the eye. The converging lens produces an image farther from the eye than the object so that the farsighted person can see it clearly.

<para id="fs-id1167062338188">Note that the minus sign causes the magnification to be negative when the image is inverted. Ray tracing and the use of the lens equation produce consistent results. The thin-lens equation gives the most precise results, and is limited only by the accuracy of the given information. Ray tracing is limited by the accuracy with which you draw, but it is highly useful both conceptually and visually.</para>

<para id="fs-id1167065953136">A number of results in this example are true of all case 3 images. Magnification is positive (as calculated), meaning the image is upright. The magnification is also less than one, meaning the image is smaller than the object—in this case, a little more than half its size. The image distance is negative, meaning the image is on the same side of the lens as the object. The image is virtual. The image is closer to the lens than the object, because the image distance is smaller in magnitude than the object distance. The location of the image is not obvious when you look through a concave lens. In fact, because the image is smaller than the object, you may think it is farther away; however, the image is closer than the object—a fact that is useful in correcting nearsightedness.</para>
